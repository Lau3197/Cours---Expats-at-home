## Understanding Belgian Taxes (Without Crying)

Belgium has a reputation for high taxes. It's true. But the system is logical.

### The Basics
*   **Income Tax (IPP):** Progressive rates from 25% up to 50% (plus communal surcharge).
*   **Precompte Professionnel (Payroll Tax):** Your employer deducts this every month from your gross salary. It is an *advance* payment on your final tax bill.
*   **ONSS (Social Security):** 13.07% of your gross salary goes to social security (healthcare, pension, unemployment). This is deducted *before* tax.

### The Tax Return (Déclaration)
*   **When:** Filed annually in **June/July** for the income of the *previous* year.
    *   *Example:* In June 2026, you file for income earned in 2025.
*   **How:** **Tax-on-Web (MyMinfin)**.
    *   The government often "Pre-fills" your return (Proposition de déclaration simplifiée). You just check if it's correct and click "Confirm".
    *   **Login:** You need "Itsme" app or an ID card reader.

### Reducing Your Taxes (Deductions)
You can lower your taxable income ('Frais Réels' vs 'Forfait') or use specific baskets:
1.  **Pension Saving (Epargne Pension):** Save ~€1,000/year in a special fund, get 30% back as a tax reduction. Highly recommended.
2.  **Service Vouchers (Titres-Services):** Hire a cleaner officially. It's subsidized and tax-deductible.
3.  **Childcare:** Nursery costs are deductible up to a certain limit per day.
4.  **Charity:** Donations of €40+ to recognized charities gives you a tax reduction (45%).

### The "Communal Tax"
Brussels has 19 communes. Each has its own tax rate (usually 6% - 8% surcharge on your income tax).
Some communes (like Evere or Etterbeek) might have separate "Fixed Taxes" for administrative costs.
If you get a bill from the commune, pay it promptly. They don't mess around.
