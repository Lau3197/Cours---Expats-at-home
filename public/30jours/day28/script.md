Day 28. The Long Game.
Where will you be in 5 years?
If the answer is "In Belgium," we need to talk about Citizenship.
Receiving a Belgian passport is one of the most powerful things you can do.
It gives you EU rights forever.

Conditions (simplified):
1. **5 Years of Residence.** Uninterrupted.
2. **Economic Participation.** You worked for at least 468 days in those 5 years.
3. **Social Integration.** A course, or a degree.
4. **Language.** A2 Level in French or Dutch.

A2 is not "Fluent." A2 is "I can order a beer and talk about the weather."
It is very achievable.
Start saving your payslips. Start saving your rental contracts.
Build your "Dossier" now.
Don't wait until Year 5 to realize you threw away a crucial document in Year 1.

Even if you leave Belgium, that passport stays with you.
It is the ultimate souvenir.
Start the clock.
