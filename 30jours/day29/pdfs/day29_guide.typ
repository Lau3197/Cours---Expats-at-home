= How to Keep Your Playbook Alive
Your playbook is a powerful tool, but only if you use it. Here’s how to make it a lasting habit.

== Step-by-Step Guide
1.  *Fill in the Basics:* Start by completing the "Quick Reference Sheet" and the "Admin & Bureaucracy" section with all the information you currently have.
2.  *Add Your First Discoveries:* Think back over the last few weeks. What café did you enjoy? What park did you walk through? Add at least three places to the "Social, Food & Fun" section.
3.  *Make it Accessible:* Decide where your playbook will live. If it's a printed document, keep it in an obvious place like your desk or kitchen counter. If it's digital, save it to your computer's desktop or a cloud service you use often.
4.  *Schedule a Monthly Update:* Set a recurring 10-minute appointment in your calendar for the first Sunday of every month. Use this time to add new contacts, update information, and add new "go-to" spots.
