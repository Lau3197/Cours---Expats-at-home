Day 6. Parlez-vous belge?
Okay, maybe not "Belgian," but French in Belgium has its own flavor.
If you learned "Standard French" in school, you might be confused when someone tells you the meeting is at "septante" minutes past the hour. Or asks you to wait "une fois."

Today is about survival French. The words you actually need.
We're not doing conjugation tables. We're doing "How to order a coffee without being ignored."
We're doing "How to apologize for bumping into someone on the Metro." (It's "Pardon," by the way).

We'll cover the magic numbers: Septante (70) and Nonante (90). Much easier than the French way of saying "Four-Twenty-Ten".
And we'll cover the greeting etiquette. One kiss? Two kisses? A handshake? It's a minefield.
(Spoiler: In Brussels, it's usually one kiss on the cheek for friends).

Confidence is key. Even a "Bonjour" said with a smile opens doors.
On y va!
