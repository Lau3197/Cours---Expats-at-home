**Infographic: Practice French Alone: 3 Simple Strategies**

Visual structure: A three-panel layout, each with a distinct icon, title, and bulleted text.

**Panel 1: Shadow Reading**
*   **Icon:** Headphones with a microphone, or a person mimicking a speaker from an audio source.
*   **Details:** Find a French podcast or simple news report. Play and repeat what the speaker says, trying to copy their rhythm and intonation. Focus on muscle memory, not understanding every word.

**Panel 2: Talk to Yourself**
*   **Icon:** A person performing a daily action (e.g., making coffee, walking) with a speech bubble above them.
*   **Details:** Narrate your actions out loud. Examples: "Je prépare mon café," "Je mets le lait dans la tasse," or describing your walk to the tram. Connect the language to your real life.

**Panel 3: Record Yourself**
*   **Icon:** A smartphone displaying a recording app interface (e.g., a microphone, waveform, "record" button).
*   **Details:** Use your phone to make a 1-minute voice memo. Talk about your day or dinner plans. Listen back to confirm you *can* speak, without self-criticism.
