## Query 1: Volunteer opportunities Brussels English 2026

<think>
The user is asking about volunteer opportunities in Brussels where English is spoken/accepted, specifically for 2026. Let me analyze the search results.

Key findings from the search results:

1. From [2] - Brussels Times article about volunteering in January and beyond:
- Red Cross shelters - welcomes volunteers with English-friendly activities
- Brussels 'greeters' program - tour guides, at least 3h/month
- Les Petits Riens - second-hand shops, 250+ volunteers
- BelRefugees - teach English, French, Dutch; prepare meals; organize cultural/sports activities; monthly info sessions
- Give a Day platform - matches volunteers to organizations
- Note: "Some activities welcome volunteers fully in English, others also serve as a way to practice French or Dutch"

2. From [3] - Official Brussels-Capital Region volunteering info:
- Multiple coordination bodies for volunteers
- European Voluntary Project for people up to 30 years old
- Two main contact organizations listed

3. From [4] - ESC Communication volunteer position:
- Located in Antwerp (not Brussels, but Belgium)
- 30 hours/week, 480 EUR/month
- English required
- Started July 2025, so this might be outdated

4. From [5] - Serve the City Brussels:
- Values-based volunteering
- ServeNow platform for registering shifts

The search results are good but limited for specifics. The most recent and comprehensive information comes from [2] which was published January 2, 2026 - very recent and timely.

I should structure this to:
1. Start with a direct answer about English-speaking opportunities
2. List the main organizations and their opportunities
3. Mention the platforms/resources for finding more
4. Note the language consideration for Brussels

Let me ensure I cite properly and follow the formatting guidelines.

Brussels offers several **English-friendly volunteer opportunities** despite the city's multilingual context. While some activities welcome volunteers fully in English, others provide opportunities to practice French or Dutch simultaneously[2].

## Established Organizations with Current Openings

**Red Cross shelters**: The Red Cross operates temporary safe places for asylum seekers across Brussels and welcomes volunteer teams to support residents. Activities include teaching language classes, helping children with homework, sorting clothes, and leading sports and creative workshops[2].

**Brussels 'greeters'**: Visit Brussels partners with the International Greeter Association to recruit volunteers who guide newcomers and visitors around the city. Greeters commit to a minimum of three hours per month guiding groups of up to six people[2].

**BelRefugees**: This organization coordinates hundreds of volunteers across Belgium to support refugees. In Brussels, volunteers can prepare and serve meals at shelters, teach English, French, or Dutch courses, help organize cultural and sports activities, and sort donated clothing at their Humanitarian Hub. The group organizes monthly information sessions for prospective volunteers[2].

**Les Petits Riens**: This second-hand shop chain and nonprofit operates with over 250 volunteers performing tasks ranging from shop assistance to sewing, content creation, and appliance repairs. You can contact them via email or their website for current openings[2].

**Serve the City Brussels**: This values-based volunteering organization uses the ServeNow platform to help volunteers register for shifts and connect with project leaders[5].

## Finding the Right Match

The **'Give a Day' platform** (recommended by the City of Brussels) allows you to filter opportunities by interests, language preferences, and location. Current examples include grocery shopping assistance, swimming support for people with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ social events[2].

For longer-term international opportunities, the **European Voluntary Service** is available to those under 30 years old[3], and ESC (European Solidarity Corps) positions exist throughout Belgium, though not all may be Brussels-based[4].

Contact the Brussels-Capital Region's coordination bodies directly for personalized guidance: **Association pour le volontariat** (+32 2 219 53 70 for French speakers) or **Kenniscentrum W³ - Steunpunt Vrijwilligerswerk Brussels** (+32 2 218 55 16 for Dutch speakers)[3].

## Query 2: NGOs Brussels hiring 2026

<think>
The user is asking about NGOs hiring in Brussels in 2026. They provided search results that contain information about job boards and specific job listings for NGOs in Brussels.

Let me analyze the search results:
1. EuroBrussels has a jobs page listing NGO and political jobs in European Affairs
2. JobsinBrussels is a job board specifically for EU affairs jobs in Brussels at NGOs, EU institutions, etc.
3. VOICE has network vacancies including positions at Plan International and Caritas Europa in Brussels
4. ImpactPool lists UN and NGO jobs
5. DevelopmentAid.org lists jobs in Belgium
6. EuroBrussels also has a recruitment list for NGOs
7. GlobalJobs.org is an international job board

The most relevant and actionable information for someone looking at NGO hiring in Brussels comes from sources 2 and 3, which specifically focus on Brussels-based NGO jobs.

From source 3, I can see specific current vacancies:
- Senior Operations Officer at Plan International (Brussels) - 6-month fixed term, starting early 2026, deadline was December 16, 2025
- Communications Officer at Caritas Europa (Brussels)

From source 1 and 6, there are job boards and resources for finding NGO jobs in Brussels.

I should provide:
1. Where to find NGO jobs in Brussels
2. Current/recent examples of positions
3. Note about the application deadlines

Let me structure this response clearly.
</think>

Several specialized job boards and platforms actively list NGO positions in Brussels for 2026:

**Primary job boards for Brussels NGO roles:**

**JobsinBrussels** and **EuroBrussels** are the main platforms dedicated to EU affairs and NGO vacancies in Brussels, aggregating positions from NGOs, EU institutions, and political organizations[1][2]. These boards allow you to filter by sector and organization type.

**Current/recent Brussels-based NGO positions include:**

- **Senior Operations Officer at Plan International (Brussels)** – A six-month fixed-term contract with likely extension, starting early 2026. Requires strong background in operations and administration, fluency in English, and good working knowledge of French[3].

- **Communications Officer at Caritas Europa (Brussels)** – The Caritas Europa secretariat is seeking a communications professional with relevant NGO, agency, EU institution, or national ministry experience[3].

**Additional resources:**

VOICE's network vacancy page lists Brussels-based NGO openings, while broader platforms like **ImpactPool** and **GlobalJobs.org** cover international NGO, UN, and development sector roles, though with wider geographic scope[4][7]. **EuroBrussels maintains a dedicated NGO recruitment list** organized by sector (environmental, aid/human rights, social/health)[6].

Many positions require French language skills (commonly called 'French' or 'good working knowledge'), so language preparation may be necessary for Brussels-based roles. Check individual job boards regularly, as vacancies are posted continuously throughout the year.
