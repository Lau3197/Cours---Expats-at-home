An image of René Magritte's painting "The Treachery of Images," prominently featuring the pipe and the original text "Ceci n'est pas une pipe." Accompanying text identifies the artist as "René Magritte, Surrealist Painter" and provides the English translation: "This is not a pipe." Additional text on the graphic links this to "Belgian humor: Dry, Ironic, Surreal" and the concept of "looking at the world a little bit sideways."
