## When the Honeymoon Ends: Handling Homesickness 🌧️

Moving abroad is glamorous on Instagram. In reality, it can be lonely.
Ideally, you build a "Raft" to stay afloat.

### The Coping Strategy
1.  **The "Home" Box:** Keep a box of things from home (snacks, photos, a specific candle). Open it when you feel low.
2.  **The Time Zone Rule:** Don't live in your old time zone. If you spend every evening on Skype with home, you aren't building a life here. Schedule calls, but limit them.
3.  **Find Your "Comfort Food":**
    *   Brussels is international. You can find American cereal, British tea, Japanese miso, Brazilian acai.
    *   *Stonemanor* (British), *Kam Yuen* (Asian), *International Home of Cooking*.
    *   Cooking a meal from home grounds you.

### Mental Health Resources
If the blues don't go away, talk to someone.
*   **English-Speaking Therapists:** Brussels has many.
    *   *CHS (Community Help Service):* 24/7 Helpline in English (02 648 40 14).
    *   *Psygroup:* International practice in Etterbeek.
*   **Sunlight:** Brussels is grey. Many expats suffer from SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder).
    *   *Tip:* Buy a "Luminotherapy" lamp. Take Vitamin D supplements (consult your doctor). It makes a huge difference.

### The "Expat Curve"
Remember: **Validation > Crisis > Adjustment.**
You are likely in the Crisis/Adjustment phase. It gets better. Suddenly, Brussels will feel like the norm and home will feel... different.
