Steps illustrating the process:
1.  **Pay Upfront:** Pay the full amount directly to the doctor (e.g., GP visit costs 30 euros).
2.  **Receive Certificate:** Get a 'small green or white piece of paper' (official certificate of visit) from the doctor.
3.  **Obtain Vignettes:** Receive a sheet of 'vignettes' (stickers with your name and member number) from your mutuelle.
4.  **Attach Sticker:** Place one 'vignette' sticker onto the doctor's paper.
5.  **Submit Form:** Drop the completed paper into the mutuelle's 'special mailbox' (often 24/7).
6.  **Reimbursement:** 'A few weeks later', receive 77 percent reimbursement directly into your account.
