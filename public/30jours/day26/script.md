Day 26. Business French.
"Cordialement."
"Bien à vous."
"En réunion."
Workplace French is a secret code. It is formal, polite, and slightly passive-aggressive.

Rule 1: **"Vous" always.**
Unless they say "On peut se tutoyer ?" (Can we say Tu?), stick to Vous. especially in emails.

Rule 2: **The Email Sandwich.**
Top: "Bonjour [Name]," (Never just the name).
Middle: The request. Use "Pourriez-vous..." (Could you...), not "Je veux..." (I want...).
Bottom: "Bien à vous" (Best) or "Cordialement" (Regards).

Rule 3: **The Phone.**
Answering: "Allô ?" or "[Company Name], Bonjour."
Ending: "Au revoir, bonne journée."
Don't just hang up. That's rude.

We'll learn the key phrases to sound professional, even if you have no idea what's going on.
"Je vous reviens vers vous." (I'll get back to you).
"C'est noté." (Noted).
Master these, and you can survive any meeting.
