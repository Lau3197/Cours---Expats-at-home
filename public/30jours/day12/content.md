## The Art of Small Talk (in French) 🥂

You can order a bread. Now let's make a friend.

### The Toast (Le Trinquer)
This is taken very seriously in Belgium.
*   **The Phrase:** "Santé !" (Health) or "Tchin-tchin !"
*   **The Rules:**
    1.  **Eye Contact:** You MUST look the person in the eye as your glasses touch.
    2.  **No Crossing:** Do not cross arms with other people toasting. Wait your turn.
    3.  **Sip After:** Don't put the glass down without taking a sip.

### Conversation Starters
*   **"Tu habites où à Bruxelles ?"** – Where do you live in Brussels? (Classic opener).
*   **"Tu fais quoi dans la vie ?"** – What do you do for a living?
*   **"Ça fait longtemps que tu es ici ?"** – Have you been here long?

### Useful Filler Words (To sound local)
*   **"Bah oui..."** (Well yes...)
*   **"C'est ça."** (That's it / Exactly.)
*   **"Ah bon ?"** (Really? / Oh?) – Use this when someone tell you something surprising.
*   **"Genre..."** (Like...) – Used by young people constantly.

### Tu vs. Vous (The Cheat Sheet)
*   **Stranger in the street:** Vous.
*   **Shopkeeper / Waiter:** Vous.
*   **Colleague (same age):** Tu (usually).
*   **Friend of a friend:** Tu.
*   **Person at a bar:** Tu (mostly).
*   **Older person / Boss:** Vous (until told otherwise).
