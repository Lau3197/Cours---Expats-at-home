An infographic with a central, prominent display of the example NISS number format: "YY.MM.DD-XXX.XX". Above this, the title "Your National Number (NISS)". Below, include the full French name *Numéro de Registre National* and Dutch name *Rijksregisternummer*. Add text clarifying it's an "11-digit unique identification number in Belgium." The overarching text overlay should be "Your Key to Belgian Life!". Surrounding the central number, use icons or short text labels to represent its essential uses: "Opening a Bank Account," "Health Insurance," "Taxes," and "Work."
