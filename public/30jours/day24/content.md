## Finding Your People in the City 🤝

Brussels can be transient. People come, people go.
To build a lasting circle, you need to be intentional.

### The "Dinner Party" Strategy
Belgians (and long-term expats) prefer intimate gatherings over loud bars.
*   **The Concept:** Start a monthly dinner club.
*   **The Rule:** Keep it simple. Spaghetti service. "Auberge Espagnole" (Potluck).
*   **The Invite:** "I'm making pasta on Tuesday. Come over." Low pressure.

### The Tribes of Brussels
Identify where you fit.
1.  **The Euro-Crowd:** Work in EU institutions. Live in Etterbeek/Ixelles.
    *   *Pros:* Intelligent, international, helpful for careers.
    *   *Cons:* Talk about work constantly. Often leave after 3 years.
2.  **The Creatives:** Artists, musicians, freelancers. Live in Saint-Gilles/Forest.
    *   *Pros:* Great parties, relaxed vibe.
    *   *Cons:* Can be cliquey.
3.  **The Locals (Brusseleirs):** Born and bred.
    *   *Pros:* If you are in, you are family for life. They know the best spots.
    *   *Cons:* Hardest shell to crack.

### "Vulnerable" Networking
Skip the small talk.
Instead of "What do you do?", ask:
*   "What are you excited about right now?"
*   "What's the best thing you ate this week?"
Connection happens in the details, not the job titles.
