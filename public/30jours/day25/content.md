## Navigating the Belgian Career Ladder 💼

Belgium offers stability and high salaries (if you know how to negotiate).

### The "Paper" Culture
Belgian employers value credentials.
*   **Diplomas:** Ensure your foreign degree is recognized (Equivalence) if applying for government jobs.
*   **Certifications:** Adding a "Prince2" (Project Management) or language certificate to your CV is powerful.

### Professional Training (Formation)
*   **Congé-Education Payé:** You legally have the right to take paid leave to study certain recognized courses.
*   **Employers Budget:** Most companies have a training budget. Use it. It shows ambition.
*   **Languages:** The #1 career booster in Brussels is speaking French or Dutch. It opens the 80% of jobs that aren't purely English-speaking.

### Networking Etiquette
*   **LinkedIn:** Very active in Belgium. Keep it updated.
*   **The Lunch Meeting:** The primary venue for business relationship building.
    *   *Rule:* Keep it personal for the first 15 mins. Don't jump straight to business.
    *   *Paying:* Usually the person who invited pays, or you split.

### The "13th Month" & Benefits
When negotiating salary, looking at the **Gross Monthly** is misleading.
Look at the **Annual Package**.
*   13.92 months of salary?
*   Company Car / Mobility Budget?
*   Meal Vouchers (€8/day tax-free)?
*   Hospitalization Insurance?
These "extras" can double the value of your package.
