Day 21. Three weeks.
You can officially say you live in Brussels.
You have survived the recycling rules. You have filed your taxes (mentally, at least). You have driven on the right side of the road (I hope).
And you might have even gone on a date!

This week was the "Adulting" week.
The boring stuff that makes life possible.
Admin. Papers. Rules.
It's not sexy. But it is freedom.
Once you understand the system, you stop fighting it. And you start living in it.

Brussels is a city of layers.
The tourist layer. The expat layer. The local layer.
You are peeling them back, one by one.
If you feel tired, that's normal. Expat fatigue is real.
But look at how far you've come.
Three weeks ago, you didn't know what a "Mutuelle" was. Now you're practically a local.

Celebrate this weekend.
Go to the Gare du Midi market on Sunday morning. It's lively, it's chaotic, it's cheap.
Buy some mint tea and a Moroccan pancake (Msemen).
And just be.
See you in Week 4. We're going deep into Culture, Politics, and... The Future.
