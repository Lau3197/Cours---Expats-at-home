Day 8. Let's eat.
Grocery shopping in a new country is an adventure.
You walk in for milk and leave with three types of pâté and a bottle of wine because it was cheaper than water.
(Okay, not really, but close).

In Belgium, the supermarket landscape is a hierarchy.
You have **Colruyt** – the efficient, warehouse-style king of low prices.
**Delhaize** – the slightly posher, "I care about the origin of my quinoa" option.
**Carrefour** – the standard all-rounder.
And the discounters: **Aldi** and **Lidl**.

Here's a tip: Bring your own bags. Always. They charge for them, and the locals will judge you if you forget.
And at Colruyt? Be prepared for the speed. The cashiers are faster than Olympians. They move products directly from one cart to another. It's a sport.

We'll also talk about the markets.
The Sunday market at Gare du Midi is legendary. You can buy anything there. Fruit, spices, clothes, maybe even a new bike (don't ask where it came from).
Food is the heart of Belgian culture. So today, we fill the fridge!
