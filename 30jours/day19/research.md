<think>
The user is asking about the best day trips from Brussels in 2026. I have search results that contain information about day trips from Brussels. Let me analyze what's available:

From the search results:
- Result [7] mentions: "Gent, Brussels, Antwerp, Leuven are very easily reached, 30-50 minutes by direct train, and they are all worth a day."
- Result [4] mentions: "THE TOP 10 Best Day Trips from Brussels to Belgium 2026"
- Result [3] mentions several day trips including:

- Result [5] mentions "37 Day Trips from Brussels: The Ultimate List for 2026" and mentions castles like Vêves Castle, Gaasbeek Castle, Reinhardstein Castle, Nature Park of Furfooz, Lion's Mound, and other attractions

- Result [2] mentions multi-day trips but also mentions destinations in Belgium like Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp

Key cities/destinations mentioned:
1. Bruges
2. Ghent
3. Antwerp
4. Leuven
5. Flanders Fields
6. Castles and nature sites

I should cite appropriately and organize this logically.

## Query 2: SNCB train deals 2026

<think>
The user is asking about SNCB train deals for 2026. Today is January 5, 2026. Let me look at the search results to find information about SNCB deals in 2026.

From the search results:

1. [1] talks about increased SNCB service starting December 14, 2025, and September 2026 (more trains, new routes, expanded suburban service)

2. [2] talks about SNCB tariffs for 2026 - fare indexation from February 1, 2026. It mentions Train+ card and new pricing structure.

3. [3] discusses a major tariff reform starting October 15 (this seems to be from 2025 based on the article date of 2025-10-06). It talks about the new pricing system with discounts, Train+ card, etc.

4. [4] appears to be an official document about tariff adaptations for February 1, 2026.

So the main "deals" for 2026 appear to be:
- Train+ card offering 40% discount in off-peak hours and weekends
- New simplified tariff system with discounts by percentage rather than special ticket types
- Price cap of 14€ per trip for adults with Train+
- Enhanced service starting December 14, 2025 and September 2026
- Tariff indexation from February 1, 2026

Let me structure this clearly with citations.
</think>

The main **SNCB deals for 2026** center on the **Train+ card** offering significant discounts and a new simplified tariff system introduced in October 2025 that continues through 2026.

## Train+ Card

The **Train+ card** provides a **40% discount during off-peak hours and weekends** for just €6/month or €48/year for adults (26-64 years), or €4/month or €32/year for young people, seniors, and BIM beneficiaries[2]. With Train+, you're guaranteed a maximum fare of **€14 per trip** in second class for adults, or **€5.50 for youth, seniors, and eligible beneficiaries**[2]. The Train+ pricing remains unchanged as of February 2026[2].

## Simplified Tariff System

The new tariff structure replaces multiple special ticket types with percentage-based discounts applicable to all trips at any time[3]. The maximum standard second-class ticket price has been reduced to **€20.90** (previously €26), calculated over a maximum distance of **120km instead of 150km**[3].

Young people, seniors, and beneficiaries of increased intervention continue receiving specific discounts across all trips, and **children under 12 travel free**[3].

## Price Changes in February 2026

From **February 1, 2026**, regulated fares will increase by **2.14% for tickets and 2.6% for subscriptions**[2]. However, the Train+ card price remains fixed, and subscription prices beyond 120km will decrease by 16% due to the distance reduction[2].

## Enhanced Service

Additional benefits include **expanded train service starting December 14, 2025**, with more frequent suburban lines around Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, and Charleroi, plus additional weekend IC connections between major cities[1].
