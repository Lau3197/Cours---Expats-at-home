## Query 1: Best supermarkets Brussels 2026 price comparison

<think>
The user is asking about the best supermarkets in Brussels in 2026 with a price comparison. Let me look through the search results for relevant information.

From the search results:
1. There's information about the most notable supermarkets: Carrefour, Bio-Planet, Delhaize, Colruyt, and Aldi
2. There's information about which offers the biggest discounts: Aldi offers the most deals
3. There's a sustainability study comparing supermarkets
4. There's pricing information for Colruyt products
5. Information about organic products being more expensive
6. General information about Belgian supermarket chains

Let me structure this answer:
1. Start with which supermarkets are considered "best" and the main factors
2. Provide price comparison data where available
3. Highlight key differences

The search results provide:
- Carrefour: longest hours (6:30 AM to 11 PM), large selection, has loyalty points
- Delhaize: oldest chain (100+ years), local and international products, 8 AM-8 PM
- Colruyt: 80+ years experience, 8:30 AM-8 PM, balanced prices, frequent discounts, less international products
- Aldi: most deals in Brussels, own brand products, prepared meals
- Bio-Planet: organic and sustainable products, 2 stores in Brussels, more expensive than conventional supermarkets
- Lidl: around 300 stores in Belgium

Pricing for Colruyt:
- 1 L yogurt: €0.79
- 1.5 L laundry detergent: €4.99
- 6 rolls toilet paper: €2.50
- 250 ml shampoo: €2.50
- Roll of trash bags: €3.00

I need to be careful with citations and follow the formatting guidelines. I should bold key supermarket names and important findings like "Aldi offers the most deals" or pricing information where relevant.

## Query 3: Belgian food specialties expats should try

<think>
The user is asking about Belgian food specialties that expats in Belgium should try. This is a straightforward informational query about Belgian cuisine tailored to expats. I have good search results that cover traditional Belgian dishes, their origins, and preparation methods.

Let me structure this response:
1. Start with a direct answer about key Belgian food specialties
2. Organize by category (main dishes, sides, desserts, etc.)
3. Use citations appropriately
4. Focus on practical information useful for expats
5. Bold key dishes/terms that are essential
6. Keep it well-formatted and readable

I'll organize this by categories of food (main dishes, sides, sweets) since that's logical and easy to follow. I should emphasize the most iconic Belgian dishes and explain why they're notable.

Let me make sure I'm following all the formatting rules:
- Bold only key words
- Use citations after statements
- No URLs
- No conclusion at the end
- Markdown formatting for clarity
- Not too much hedging language
</think>

As an expat in Belgium, you should prioritize trying **moules-frites**, **Flemish beef stew** (carbonade flamande), and **Belgian fries**—these are considered the country's most iconic dishes.[1][2]

## Main Dishes

**Waterzooi** is a creamy stew originating from Ghent, traditionally made with chicken (though it evolved from fish when freshwater supplies became scarce).[3] The dish features a luxurious broth thickened with egg yolks and cream, infused with leeks, carrots, and celery, and is typically served with crusty bread.[3]

**Moules-frites** (mussels with fries) are especially popular along the coast and in summer months.[1][3] The mussels are steamed with garlic, onions, parsley, and white wine, then served alongside double-fried Belgian fries.[3] North Sea mussels are at their best from June through April, particularly in summer.[4]

**Carbonade flamande** (Flemish beef stew) is Belgium's answer to French boeuf bourguignon, but substitutes dark beer for wine.[3] The slow-cooked beef absorbs the malty sweetness of the beer, and mustard adds layers of tangy flavor.[3]

**Paling in 't groen** (eel in green herb sauce) is a traditional Flemish dish featuring freshwater eel in a bright sauce made from parsley, sorrel, and mint, typically served with boiled potatoes or bread.[3]

## Sides & Lighter Dishes

**Belgian fries** (frietjes) are supposedly the inspiration for French fries and are Belgium's unofficial national dish.[4] They're made from fine potatoes, double-fried for crispiness, and typically served with mayonnaise.[1][4] Dedicated fry stands called **frituur** are common throughout the country.[4]

**Croquettes aux crevettes** (grey shrimp croquettes) feature a creamy béchamel filling mixed with tiny North Sea shrimp, often served with lemon and fried parsley.[2] **Tomate aux crevettes** is another popular preparation—a hollowed tomato stuffed with peeled shrimp mixed with cocktail sauce.[2]

**Chicon au gratin** (endive gratin) combines bitter Belgian endives wrapped in ham, smothered in béchamel sauce, and topped with melted cheese before baking.[3]

## Sweets & Desserts

**Belgian waffles** come in Liège style (with sugar crystals and toppings like chocolate and strawberries) and are widely available.[2]

**Speculoos** cookies are traditional spiced treats, often paired with coffee.[2] **Pain d'épices** (ontbijtkoek) is spiced bread, while **cuberdon** candies are local specialties.[2]

**Tarte au riz** (rijstevlaai) from Verviers is a regional dessert worth seeking out.[2] **Couque de Dinant** is a traditional biscuit from the town of Dinant.[2]

## Practical Notes

Most traditional Belgian meals center around **meat or fish served with fries, vegetables, and sauce**.[1] **Liège syrup**—a thick, fruity condiment—frequently enhances vegetable dishes and desserts.[1] Belgian cuisine traditionally emphasizes **regional and seasonal ingredients**, including potatoes, leeks, white asparagus, and local beer.[2]

Pair your meals with Belgian beer, which is integral to the dining experience and reflects Belgium's strong brewing tradition.[1]
