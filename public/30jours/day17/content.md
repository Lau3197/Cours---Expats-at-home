## Surviving Belgian Roads 🚗

Belgium has a dense road network and aggressive drivers (sorry, but it's true).

### The Golden Rule: Priority to the Right
**"Priorité de Droite"**
Unless a sign (yellow diamond) or shark-teeth markings on the floor indicate otherwise, **traffic coming from the right has priority.**
*   **The Danger:** This applies even if you are on a seemingly main road and the car on the right is exiting a small alley.
*   **Exception:** If the car on the right is coming from a dirt path, a driveway, or has a "Stop" / "Yield" sign.
*   **Advice:** Slow down at every intersection where you don't see a priority sign for yourself.

### Driving Licenses (Permis de Conduire)
1.  **EU Citizens:** Your home license is valid. You *can* register it with the commune (recommended in case of theft), but you don't have to exchange it until it expires.
2.  **Non-EU Citizens:** You generally have **185 days** after registration to drive with your foreign license.
    *   **Action:** Go to your commune ASAP to execute an **Exchange (Echange)**.
    *   **The Trap:** If you wait too long (often > 1 year), they might refuse the exchange and force you to take the Belgian theoretical and practical exam. Avoid this at all costs.

### Parking Zones
*   **Underground:** Safest but expensive (€20+/day).
*   **Red Zone:** Paid ($$$). Max 2 hours.
*   **Blue Zone:** Free for 2 hours *IF* you use a **Parking Disc (Disque de Stationnement)** set to your arrival time.
*   **Residents:** If you buy a car, register it at the commune to get a "Carte Riverain" (Resident Card). It allows you to park in your neighborhood for free/cheap.

### Alcohol Limits
*   **Limit:** 0.5 g/l (same as France/Germany). This is essentially **one beer**.
*   **Checks:** Police controls ("Bob" campaigns) are frequent on weekend nights.
