## Query 1: Belgian work culture 2026 expats guide

<think>
The user is asking for a guide on Belgian work culture in 2026 for expats. Let me review the search results to see what information is available about Belgian work culture and employment conditions in 2026.

From the search results, I have:
1. Employment outlook for Q1 2026 - hiring slowdown, regional differences, sector-specific trends
2. New federal employment law measures for 2026 - trial periods, overtime, flexible working, wage measures
3. New regulations in 2026 - foreign worker rules, unemployment rules, sick leave, overtime rules
4. General employment laws in Belgium - written contracts, 38-hour workweek
5. Team motivation during slow periods - retention importance
6. Uncertainty about attracting/retaining talent in 2026
7. Labor migration rules - focus on "knowledge migration"
8. Job mobility - 51% of Belgian professionals intend to change jobs by 2026

The search results are not specifically about "Belgian work culture" in the traditional sense (like communication styles, hierarchy, meetings, etc.). However, they do provide practical, actionable information for expats about employment conditions, regulations, and the job market in Belgium for 2026.

The search results contain information about:
- Employment market conditions in 2026
- New employment laws and regulations
- Work flexibility and working time rules
- Wage measures
- Talent retention challenges
- Foreign worker regulations
- Job mobility trends

I should structure this as a practical guide for expats, synthesizing the information from these search results. I should be clear about what information is from the sources and acknowledge that the search results focus more on employment/labor conditions rather than cultural aspects.

Let me organize this around practical aspects that matter to expats:
1. Employment market outlook
2. Employment laws and regulations in 2026
3. Working conditions and flexibility
4. Talent and retention challenges
5. Foreign worker considerations

I need to cite appropriately and avoid over-bolding. Let me keep citations specific and relevant.

# Belgian Work Culture 2026: Expat Guide

The search results focus primarily on employment conditions and regulations rather than cultural aspects of Belgian work. However, they provide practical insights for expats navigating the Belgian job market and workplace in 2026.

## Employment Market Outlook

**Belgian employers are planning a hiring slowdown in early 2026** due to economic uncertainty.[1] Of employers surveyed, 32% expect to increase their workforce by the end of March 2026, while 17% plan to reduce headcount, resulting in a Net Employment Outlook of +14%.[1] Belgium ranks 15th among 19 European countries surveyed, ahead of the UK (+13%) but significantly behind the Netherlands (+36%), Germany (+24%), and France (+21%).[1]

Hiring varies by region: **Flanders shows stronger resilience (+20%) compared to Brussels (+15%) and Wallonia (+8%)**.[1] Growth sectors include Hospitality (+46%), Professional, Scientific & Technical Services (+31%), and Trade & Logistics (+28%), while Public Sector, Health & Social Services (0%), and Construction & Real Estate (-1%) show pessimistic hiring intentions.[1]

## Key Employment Law Changes for 2026

Several regulatory shifts affect working conditions:

- **Trial periods** have been reintroduced with a 6-month probationary period allowing dismissal or resignation with one week's notice.[2]
- **Flexible overtime** has been extended to 360 annual hours for all workers, with 240 hours entitled to overtime pay. HORECA sector workers can access up to 450 hours annually.[2]
- **Working time rules** are being relaxed to allow greater flexibility between employers and employees within EU limits (maximum 48 hours per week averaged over 4 months). The government is creating frameworks for annualized or "accordion work schedules" with employee consent.[2]
- **Net wage increases** are planned for 2027 through expanded tax-free income basis and reduced social security contributions.[2]
- **Foreign worker regulations** in Flanders now prioritize "knowledge migration" and medium-skilled shortage occupations.[7]

## Work-Life Balance and Remote Work

Belgium's **standard workweek is 38 hours**.[4] The government is promoting "teletrain work" (remote work on commuter trains) and introducing adjusted rules for **digital nomads** to tie them to Belgian social security.[2]

## Talent Retention Challenges

**Belgian organizations face growing uncertainty about attracting and retaining talent as 2026 approaches.**[6] Notably, **51% of Belgian professionals intend to change jobs by 2026**, with 27% citing financial reasons as their primary motivation.[8] Given high dismissal and recruitment costs in Belgium, **talent retention has become a critical HR priority**, particularly during economic slowdowns.[5]

## Practical Considerations for Expats

- **Written employment contracts** are legally required, outlining job descriptions, wages, work hours, and employment conditions.[4]
- Expect formal business meetings and punctuality to be highly valued; dress codes tend toward formal or smart casual depending on company tradition.[4]
- Job mobility is high, so understanding your contract terms—particularly notice periods, which vary based on tenure—is essential.

Note that employment laws continue to evolve, so verifying specific regulations with your employer or HR professional is recommended before signing employment contracts or relocating.

<think>
The user is asking about networking events for professionals in Brussels in 2026. Let me analyze the search results:

2. Result [2] from Eventbrite shows networking events in Brussels/Brussel, though many dates mentioned are from 2025 (November). It lists various events but the dates shown are mostly in the past relative to January 2026 or upcoming dates that aren't clearly specified for 2026.
3. Result [3] from b2Match lists networking events in Belgium, including:
   - Jan 20-21, 2026: Horizon Europe on-site Matchmaking for Cluster 6 - Calls 2026 in Brussels

7. Result [8] mentions hub.brussels which has business workshops and networking events but doesn't list specific ones
8. Result [9] is a general site for business conferences

The current date is January 5, 2026, so I should focus on upcoming events in 2026. Let me structure this with the most relevant and current information about 2026 networking events.

Key events I can cite:
- Horizon Europe on-site Matchmaking for Cluster 6 (Jan 20-21, 2026) [3]

I'll explore additional resources to expand networking opportunities. Hub.brussels offers ongoing business workshops, and platforms like Eventbrite and b2Match continuously update professional events. Professionals should regularly check these sites, subscribe to newsletters, and follow local business associations for the most current networking opportunities in Brussels.
