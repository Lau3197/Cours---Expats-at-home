## The Complex Art of Belgian Recycling ♻️

In Brussels, sorting trash is a civic duty. The rules are strict, and fines exist (though rarely applied to beginners, usually you just get a "red sticker" of shame).

### The Bag System (Bruxelles-Propreté)
You buy these specific bags at the supermarket. Black bin liners are forbidden.
1.  **Blue Bag (PMC):**
    *   *What:* Plastic bottles, flasks, trays, yogurt pots, mushroom punnets, metal cans, drink cartons (Tetra Pak).
    *   *Rule:* Empty them. Crush them flat to save space.
2.  **Yellow Bag (Paper):**
    *   *What:* Newspapers, magazines, cardboard boxes, printer paper.
    *   *Rule:* Fold boxes flat. If you have big piles, tie them with string.
3.  **Green/Orange Bag (Organic):**
    *   *What:* Vegetable peelings, leftovers, coffee grounds.
    *   *Note:* Mandatory in Brussels since May 2023.
4.  **White Bag (Residual):**
    *   *What:* Hygiene waste, dirty pizza boxes, broken glass (wrapped), everything else.
    *   *Rule:* This is the most expensive bag. Recycle more = Save money.

### Glass (The Walk of Shame)
Glass bottles and jars do NOT go in bags.
You must walk them to a **Bulle à Verre** (Glass Igloo) in your neighborhood.
*   **White Hole:** Interior/White glass.
*   **Green Hole:** Colored glass.
*   **Etiquette:** Do not throw glass between 10 PM and 7 AM. It is incredibly loud.

### The Collection Schedule
*   Bags must be put out **after 6 PM** the evening before collection, or **before 6 AM** on the day of collection.
*   Check your specific schedule on the **Recycle! App** or Brussels-Cleanliness website.

> **Chemicals/Electronics/Batteries:**
> DO NOT put these in bags. Take them to a "Proxy Chimik" or a Container Park (Recypark).
> Batteries have collection boxes in every supermarket (BeBat).
