## Query 1: Belgian French differences 2026

<think>
The user is asking about Belgian French differences in 2026. The current date is January 4, 2026, but this is just for context - it's not particularly relevant to the query about Belgian French differences, which are linguistic/cultural facts that don't change significantly year to year.

Let me organize the key differences between Belgian French and French from France based on the search results:

1. Pronunciation differences (accent, R sound)
2. Number system (septante/nonante)
3. Vocabulary differences
4. Common expressions
5. Overall mutual intelligibility

I need to cite each fact properly and structure this clearly. Let me go through systematically:

- Belgian and French speakers can understand each other (mutual intelligibility)
- Pronunciation differences: softer R, accent
- Number system: septante (70) and nonante (90)
- Various vocabulary differences
- Common expressions like "drache," "à tantôt," "une fois"
- Some archaic French and Dutch loanwords

Let me structure this clearly with proper citations.

**Belgian French and French from France are mutually intelligible**, though they differ in pronunciation, numbers, and vocabulary.[1][4]

## Pronunciation and Accent

The **Belgian "R" is softer and less guttural** than the French R, pronounced more like the Québécois version.[1] The overall Belgian accent is characterized by a **more dragging quality**, with speakers sounding slightly slower compared to standard French, similar to Swiss French.[2] The accent is particularly distinctive in Brussels, known for its characteristic rolling of the letter R.[6]

## Number System

A major practical difference is the **Belgian number system**: Belgians use **septante** for 70 and **nonante** for 90, whereas France uses *soixante-dix* (sixty-ten) and *quatre-vingt-dix* (four-twenty-ten).[1][3] All other numbers from 1-100 are identical between the two varieties.[3]

## Vocabulary and Expressions

Belgian French includes unique vocabulary, often influenced by Dutch loanwords, and some words considered archaic in standard French.[4] Common Belgian-specific terms include:

- **"Drache"** – it's pouring rain (heavy rain)[1]
- **"À tantôt"** – see you later (very old French, rarely used in France)[3]
- **"Une fois"** – a filler word added to soften sentences (doesn't literally mean "once")[1][6]
- **"Crollés"** – curly hair (versus *boucles* in France)[3]
- **"Affone"** – to drink in one go (versus *boit cul sec* in France)[3]

Other differences appear in daily objects and food vocabulary.[1] Additionally, **"s'il vous plaît" means both "please" and "here"** in Belgian French, whereas France uses "voilà" for "here"—reflecting Dutch influence.[5]

## Overall Differences

The lexical differences are **minor and comparable to regional variations within American English**, far less significant than differences across the United Kingdom.[5] These differences stem partly from **Dutch loanwords and Germanic influences** due to Belgium's multilingual environment.[4][5]
