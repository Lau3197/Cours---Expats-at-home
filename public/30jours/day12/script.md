Day 12. Social French.
We've done the "Survival French" for shops. Now we do the "Party French."
You're at a dinner. You're at a bar. You need to chat.

Number one rule: The "Apéro" etiquette.
When you toast ("chin chin" or "santé"), look people in the eye.
Seriously. If you don't, it's 7 years of bad... luck. (That's the polite version).
And you don't cross glasses.

We'll learn how to switch topics gracefully.
"Au fait..." (By the way...)
"Dis-moi..." (Tell me...)
And the most important phrase if you don't understand:
"Désolé, je ne parle pas très bien français, on peut parler anglais ?"
(Sorry, I don't speak very well, can we speak English?)
Use this *after* trying French. It makes all the difference.

We'll also cover the "Tu" vs "Vous" trap.
In a bar? Almost always "Tu".
At a formal dinner with your boss's wife? "Vous".
When in doubt, wait for them to use "Tu" first.
Santé!
