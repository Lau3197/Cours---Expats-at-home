## Fake It 'Til You Make It (In French) 🇫🇷

You've been here 3 weeks. It's time to stop apologizing for your French.

### The Confidence Toolkit
1.  **Filler Words (Les Mots "Tampon"):**
    *   Use these while thinking. It sounds better than "Uhhhh."
    *   *Allez...* (Come on / Well...)
    *   *En fait...* (Actually...)
    *   *Du coup...* (So / Consequently...) - Belgians use this 50 times a day.
    *   *Tu vois ?* (You see?)
2.  **The "Desolé" Trap:**
    *   Stop starting every sentence with "Désolé je ne parle pas bien."
    *   Just speak. If they don't understand, *then* apologize.
3.  **Accent:**
    *   Don't try to sound perfectly French. You have an accent. It's charming. Own it.
    *   Focus on **Intonation** (the melody) rather than perfect pronunciation.

### Resources for Intermediate Learners
*   **Media:**
    *   *RTBF Auvio:* The Belgian streaming platform. Free account. Watch local news/shows.
    *   *Series:* "La Trêve" (Belgian Noir), "Into the Night" (Netflix Belgian thriller).
*   **Conversation Tables (Tables de Conversation):**
    *   Events where people meet to speak French.
    *   Look on Meetup.com or ask at your local library (Bibliothèque).
    *   **Muntpunt** (Dutch library) also organizes French tables!

### The Challenge
Go to a shop. Ask a question you know the answer to.
"À quelle heure vous fermez ?" (What time do you close?)
Just to hear the numbers and say "Merci."
Success builds on success.
