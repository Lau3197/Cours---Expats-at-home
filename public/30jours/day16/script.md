Day 16. The Scary One. Taxes.
"Impôts." "Belasting."
I'm not going to lie. Belgium is a high-tax country.
But we are not going to talk about the percentages today (because it will make you cry).
We are going to talk about the **Process**.

If you are an employee, your taxes are deducted at source (Precompte Professionnel).
This means what hits your bank account is yours, right?
Mostly.
But you still have to file a Tax Return (Déclaration) once a year, usually in June.
Why? Because the government might owe YOU money. (Or you owe them a bit of adjustment).

Key concept: **Tax-on-Web**.
Gone are the days of paper forms. You log in with "It's Me" (the digital ID app), click a few buttons (often it's pre-filled!), and submit.
It is surprisingly efficient.

We'll also touch on "Communal Taxes."
This is a small tax just for living in your specific village (Commune).
Sometimes it's €0. Sometimes it's €150.
It depends on your postcode.
Don't panic when the brown envelope arrives. It's normal.
Let's demystify the beast.
