Day 14. Two weeks down.
You are no longer a "new arrival." You are a resident in training.
You have a mutuelle. You know where to buy groceries without going bankrupt. You have made a friend (or at least talked to a stranger).
And you know that "Septante" is superior to "Soixante-dix."

This week was about **Connection**.
Connecting with people, connecting with colleagues, connecting with the city.
Integration is a marathon, not a sprint.
Some days you will love Brussels. Some days (usually when it rains and the bus is late), you will hate it.
That's normal. That's love.

Your task for today? Nothing.
Or rather, something purely fun.
Go eat some fries. Real ones. From a "Frituur" or "Friterie."
Order them with "Sauce Andalouse" or "Samurai" if you like spice.
Sit on a bench. Eat your fries. Watch the world go by.
You live here. How cool is that?
See you in Week 3. We're getting serious about Money, Taxes, and... Recycling.
Bon appétit!
