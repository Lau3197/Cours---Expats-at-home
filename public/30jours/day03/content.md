## The Belgian Healthcare System Explained

Belgium has one of the best healthcare systems in the world, but it works on a **Reimbursement Model**. You pay upfront, and the insurance pays you back.

### The "Mutuelle" (Mutualité / Ziekenfonds)
Every resident must join a Mutuelle. These are the intermediaries between you and the state health insurance fund (INAMI).
They all offer the **same basic mandatory coverage** (remboursement) set by the government.
However, they compete on "extra" benefits (sport club refunds, baby bonuses, osteopathy coverage).

**Top Mutuelles in Brussels:**
*   **Partenamut** (Very popular with French-speaking expats)
*   **CM (Christelijke Mutualiteit) / MC (Mutualité Chrétienne)** (Largest in Belgium)
*   **Solidaris** (Socialist leaning, strong coverage)
*   **CAAMI / HZIV** (The absolute basic state coverage, free administration, no extra perks)

### Improving Your Coverage
Since the state only reimburses ~75%, many Belgians and expats take:
1.  **Hospitalization Insurance (Assurance Hospitalisation):** Critical. It covers the remaining 25% and private rooms if you need surgery or overnight stays. Often a perk from employers.
2.  **Ambulatory Insurance (Dental / Optical):** For glasses and expensive dental work.

### Finding a Doctor
You are free to choose any GP (General Practitioner).
*   **General Practitioner (Médecin Généraliste):** Your first point of contact.
*   **Specialist:** You can go directly, but it's cheaper if your GP refers you.
*   **English Speaking Doctors:** Brussels has many! Use platforms like **DoctorAnytime** or **Rosa** to filter by language.

> **Important:** Always ask if a doctor is "conventionné". This means they agree to the official state prices. "Non-conventionné" doctors can charge whatever they want, and you will still only get reimbursed based on the official rate!
