Day 22. Habit.
Brussels is not a city you visit. It's a city you live in.
And living requires Routine.
The magic of integration happens when you stop thinking about "what to do" and just do it.

Your Tuesday night yoga class.
Your Thursday evening "Apero" with colleagues.
Your Saturday morning croissant run.
These loops are what make a place feel like Home.

If you don't have a local cafe yet, find one.
Go there 3 times this week.
Order the same thing.
By the 4th time, the barista will nod at you.
That nod? That is the Golden Ticket of citizenship.
It means: "I see you. You belong here."

Also, explore the "Quartier Life."
Brussels is a collection of villages.
Maybe you live in Ixelles, but your yoga is in Saint-Gilles and your work is in Etterbeek.
Connect the dots. Find your path.
Routine isn't boring. Routine is belonging.
