Day 13. Sunday Strolls.
Brussels is a collection of villages. You live in one, but have you visited the others?
Today we leave the tourist trap of the Grand Place (it's beautiful, but you don't live there).
We need to find your "Third Place." Not work, not home. Your spot.

Have you climbed the hill to the **Mont des Arts** at sunset? It's the best view in the city.
Have you walked through the **Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert** just to window shop chocolate you can't afford?
Have you found the hidden **Egmont Park**? It's right in the center but totally silent.

Brussels rewards the curious.
Walk down Rue de Flandre for the cool restaurants.
Go to Place du Châtelain on Wednesday for the market vibe.
Go to the Marolles for the vintage shops and the true "Brusseleir" spirit.

Your mission: Get lost.
Put away Google Maps for an hour. Turn down a street because it looks pretty.
Find a park. Find a bench. Claim it.
This city is yours to discover.
