## Query 1: Belgium tax system expats 2026

<think>
The user is asking about Belgium's tax system for expats in 2026. This is a broad query, so I should provide a comprehensive overview of the key tax provisions for expatriates in Belgium for 2026, particularly highlighting recent changes that took effect on January 1, 2025, and are retroactive.

Key points from the search results:
1. Recent changes to the expatriate tax regime (effective January 1, 2025, retroactively)
2. Personal income tax brackets
3. The new expat regime requirements
4. The cost-of-living allowance changes
5. New capital gains tax starting January 1, 2026
6. Other changes like donation tax reductions

I should organize this clearly and cite each fact appropriately. Let me structure this to be most useful for an expat:
- Overview of recent regime changes
- Income tax rates
- Expat regime eligibility and benefits
- New capital gains tax
- Other relevant changes

I need to be careful with citations and avoid including URLs.
</think>

Belgium's expatriate tax regime underwent **significant changes effective January 1, 2025** (retroactively), making it more favorable for incoming workers.[2][4]

## Expatriate Tax Regime

The new inbound expatriate system now requires a **minimum gross annual salary of €70,000** (lowered from €75,000) and offers a tax-free **cost-of-living allowance of up to 35% of gross salary with no upper limit**, replacing the previous 30% allowance capped at €90,000.[2][4] Eligible expatriates must have had no Belgian tax residence or work within the 60 months prior to arrival.[2]

These changes apply retroactively to employees hired from January 1, 2025, and companies have a three-month window from Official Gazette publication to file applications, allowing workers hired earlier in 2025 to benefit retroactively.[2]

## Income Tax Rates

Belgium applies a **progressive income tax system** ranging from 25% to 50%, depending on income level:[1]

- Up to €15,200: 25%
- €15,200–€26,830: 40%
- €26,830–€46,440: 45%
- Above €46,440: 50%

All tax amounts are increased by municipal taxes, which range between 0% and 9%.[3]

## New Capital Gains Tax

A significant development for 2026 is the introduction of a **10% capital gains tax on financial assets starting January 1, 2026**.[6] Capital gains accrued before your arrival in Belgium are not taxable; only gains generated after arrival are subject to this tax.[5] A €10,000 annual exemption applies, though residents arriving partway through the year receive a prorated exemption in their first year.[5]

## Other Changes

The tax reduction for donations decreases from 45% to 30% as of tax year 2026.[7]

**Important:** Companies should verify current rules with payroll providers, as the three-month application window for retroactive benefits was critical for early-2025 hires.[2]

## Query 2: Tax-on-web Belgium 2026 guide

<think>
The user is asking for a Tax-on-web Belgium 2026 guide. Today is January 5, 2026. Let me look through the search results for information about Tax-on-web.

From the search results:

From [4]: "You can do everything online yourself, via the official website Tax-on-web, until the 16th of October 2025."

From [5]: "Most Belgian Personal Income Tax (PIT) returns are due June 30, 2026 for 2025 income (paper filing). Online filing deadlines are typically extended to July 15, 2026, with complex returns (such as self-employment or foreign income) due by October 16, 2026."

From [9]: "Have you not yet submitted your tax return? Do it as soon as possible, preferably via MyMinfin (Tax-on-web). Have you received a proposal for a simplified tax ..."

From [10]: "You can file online at Belgium's Federal Public Service Finance website. The Belgian government will mail paper returns. Preparation is key."

So the search results mention Tax-on-web but don't provide a comprehensive guide. I have limited information here:
- Tax-on-web is the official online platform
- It's also referred to as MyMinfin
- Deadlines vary: June 30, 2026 for paper; July 15, 2026 for online; October 16, 2026 for complex returns
- One source mentions "until 16th of October 2025" but that seems to be referring to the 2024 tax year deadline

Since the current date is January 5, 2026, I should note relevant deadlines for 2026 tax filing.

The search results don't provide a comprehensive "guide" to Tax-on-web - it's mostly just mentions of it as the platform to use. I need to be honest about the limitations of the search results while providing what information is available.
</think>

**Tax-on-web** is Belgium's official online platform for filing personal income tax returns, also accessible through **MyMinfin**[9].

## Key Filing Deadlines for 2026

For 2025 income tax returns filed in 2026, the deadlines are[5]:

- **June 30, 2026** – Paper filing deadline
- **July 15, 2026** – Standard online filing deadline (Tax-on-web)
- **October 16, 2026** – Extended deadline for complex returns, including those involving self-employment or foreign income

## How to Access Tax-on-web

You can file completely online through the official website via the Federal Public Service Finance website[10]. The platform allows you to handle your entire tax submission digitally rather than using paper forms.

## Current Status

Since we are in early January 2026, the filing period for 2025 income is now open. If you have not yet submitted your return, you should do so as soon as possible[9]. The search results indicate this is the preferred method of filing, though paper returns remain an option with earlier deadlines.

**Note:** The search results provide limited details about Tax-on-web's specific features and functions. For comprehensive guidance on using the platform, including step-by-step instructions or technical support, you may need to visit the official Belgian tax authority website or contact them directly, as this information is not fully covered in available sources.

## Query 3: Belgium child benefits groeipakket 2026

<think>
The user is asking about Belgium child benefits, specifically the Groeipakket in 2026. This is a clear question about current information relevant to an expat in Brussels. Let me analyze the search results:

1. Source [1]: General info about birth grants and family allowances in Belgium, mentions that almost all children are entitled to them, with different regional programs (Flanders = Groeipakket, Brussels = Famiris, Wallonia = AVIQ)

2. Source [2]: Specific payment dates for the Groeipakket (Flanders) in 2026 with the basic amount of €184.62 per month

5. Source [5]: Brief mention about School Bonus changes for 2026

The user is asking generally about "Belgium child benefits groeipakket 2026" - they might be in Flanders or need general information. I should provide comprehensive information about what the Groeipakket is, key amounts for 2026, and payment dates. I could also note that the system varies by region.

Let me structure this:
1. Direct answer: What is the Groeipakket and key 2026 info
2. Basic amounts and structure
3. Payment dates for 2026
4. Regional variations
5. Eligibility basics

I need to be careful with citations and follow the formatting rules.
