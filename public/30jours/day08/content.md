## The Belgian Grocery Guide 🛒

Food quality in Belgium is generally very high. But knowing *where* to shop can save you hundreds of euros a month.

### The Major Supermarkets
1.  **Colruyt:**
    *   *Vibe:* Warehouse, industrial, bulk buying.
    *   *Pros:* Cheapest prices (they match competitors).
    *   *Quirk:* No conveyor belts. The staff moves items from your full cart to an empty cart at lightning speed.
2.  **Delhaize:**
    *   *Vibe:* Standard to Upscale.
    *   *Pros:* Excellent fresh produce, great wine selection, "local" focus.
    *   *Cons:* More expensive.
3.  **Carrefour (Hyper / Market / Express):**
    *   *Express* shops are everywhere and open Sundays/late, but are VERY expensive. Use only for emergencies.
4.  **Aldi / Lidl:**
    *   *Vibe:* Discounters.
    *   *Pros:* Great value staples, surprisingly good chocolate and pastries.

### Market Culture
Belgians love an outdoor market (le marché).
*   **Gare du Midi (Sunday):** Huge. Chaotic. Incredibly cheap produce. Go at 1:30 PM for "end of market" deals.
*   **Place Flagey (Sat/Sun):** trendy, rotisserie chicken, oysters, champagne.
*   **Châtelain (Wed afternoon):** It's basically an open-air bar that sells some cheese. The place to be seen.

### Recycling & Trash (Strict!)
Brussels is strict on recycling.
*   **Yellow Bags:** Paper / Cardboard.
*   **Blue Bags:** Plastic / Cans / Cartons (PMC).
*   **White Bags:** General residual waste.
*   **Green/Orange Bags:** Organic / Food waste (Mandatory in many specific communes now).
*   **Glass:** Must be taken to bottle banks (Bulles à verre). Do not put in bags!

> **Returnable Bottles (Vidanges):** Many beer and water bottles have a deposit (€0.10 - €0.25). Return them to the machine at the supermarket for a voucher.
