## Cracking the "Brussels Bubble"

Brussels is two cities in one: the "Euro-Bubble" of expats who come and go, and the "Real" city of locals who stay.
Ideally, you want friends in both.

### The Belgian Character 🇧🇪
*   **Reserved:** Belgians value privacy. They don't typically share their life story in the first 5 minutes.
*   **Loyal:** Once you are "in", you are family.
*   **Humble:** Boasting is frowned upon. Self-deprecation is the national humor.
*   **Direct (but Polite):** Not as blunt as the Dutch, not as indirect as the British. Somewhere in between.

### How to Meet People
1.  **Shared Activities (The Best Way):**
    *   Belgians socialize around *structure*.
    *   **Sports:** Cycling clubs, climbing gyms (very popular), or running groups.
    *   **Culture:** Art classes, choir, board game nights.
2.  **The "Apero":**
    *   The after-work drink is sacred. Thursday night is big in Brussels (Place du Luxembourg is famous, but very expat-heavy).
    *   Try local bars in **Saint-Gilles** (Parvis) or **Ixelles** (Place Flagey) for a better mix.
3.  **Language Exchanges:**
    *   Go to "Conversation Tables." You teach your language, they teach theirs. Instant ice-breaker.

### The "Expat Trap"
It is easy to only hang out with other expats. You speak the same language, have the same problems, and live in the same neighborhoods.
**Challenge:** Try to make *one* Belgian friend this month.
How? Ask a colleague for lunch. Chat to your neighbor. Go to a local community event (Fête de quartier).
It grounds you in the country and makes you feel less like a tourist.
