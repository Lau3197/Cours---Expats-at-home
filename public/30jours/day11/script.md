Day 11. Work hard, play hard?
Well, in Belgium, it's more like: Work efficiently, go home.
Belgian work culture is all about **balance**.
The "38-hour week" is respected.
You don't get bonus points for staying until 8 PM. People will just wonder why you are inefficient.

Hierarchy is... interesting.
It can be quite formal. You use "Vous" with the boss until told otherwise.
But decision-making? That is pure **Compromise**.
We have a word: "Le Compromis à la Belge" (The Belgian Compromise).
It means: Nobody is happy, but everyone can live with it.
Meetings can be long because everyone needs to be heard. We build consensus.
It drives Americans crazy. But it keeps the peace.

Also: Lunch.
It's not a sad sandwich at your desk. It's a break. Colleagues eat together. They talk.
Join them! That Sandwich Club at lunch is where the real networking happens.

And finally: Taxes.
Yes, they are high. You look at your gross salary, then your net, and you cry.
But remember Day 3? The healthcare? The cheap education? The clean streets? (Mostly clean).
That's where the money goes. It's the social contract.
Let's get to work!
