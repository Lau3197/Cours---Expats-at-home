Content:
A document titled "Week 3 Reflection" prominently featured. Below the title, clearly list the three key reflection questions:
*   My Biggest Success So Far
*   My Biggest Challenge
*   My Goal for the Next 21 Days

The presentation should clearly communicate that this is a personal, private tool for self-assessment, designed to help adjust approach and transition from the "survival" phase to the "belonging" phase of the course.
