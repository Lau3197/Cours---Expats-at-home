## Cracking the Brussels Rental Market

Brussels offers high-quality housing at prices often lower than London or Paris, but the legal framework is strict.

### The Contracts (Le Bail)
1.  **Standard "9-Year" Lease (3-6-9 Contract):**
    *   Most common.
    *   **Duration:** 9 years, but flexible for the tenant.
    *   **Leaving:** You can leave at any time with 3 months' notice.
    *   **Penalties:** If you leave in Year 1 (3 months' rent penalty), Year 2 (2 months), Year 3 (1 month). After Year 3? No penalty!
2.  **Short-Term Lease (Bail de courte durée):**
    *   3 years or less.
    *   **Rigid:** Very hard to break before the end date unless there is a specific diplomatic clause.
    *   **Renewal:** Can only be renewed once up to a total of 3 years.

### The Inventory (État des Lieux)
This is a formal, detailed report of the apartment's condition.
*   **Mandatory:** Must be done when you move in and move out.
*   **The Expert:** It is standard practice to hire a private surveyor (géomètre-expert). Cost is ~€300-€500, shared 50/50 between tenant and landlord.
*   **Why?** The surveyor protects YOU from being charged for pre-existing damage.

### Rent Indexation
Your rent will likely go up every year on the anniversary of your lease. This is called "Indexation" and is tied to the cost of living index (Health Index). It is legal and standard.

### Where to Live? Neighborhood Guide
*   **Saint-Gilles:** Boho-chic, young, art nouveau architecture, great nightlife.
*   **Ixelles (Châtelain):** Upscale, expat-heavy, amazing restaurants, pricey.
*   **Etterbeek:** Calm, close to EU institutions, family-friendly.
*   **City Center (Dansaert/Sainte-Catherine):** Urban, trendy, gritty in parts, very lively.
*   **Uccle:** Green, posh, further from center, quiet money.
