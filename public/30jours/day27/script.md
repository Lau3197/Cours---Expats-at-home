Day 27. Giving Back.
You usually start by taking from a city. Taking space, taking jobs, taking resources.
But to truly belong, you have to give back.
Volunteering in Brussels is surprisingly easy and rewarding.
And you don't always need to speak French or Dutch.

There is "Serve the City." They are amazing.
They organize days where you paint schools, feed the homeless, or visit the elderly.
It's in English. It's flexible. You sign up for one day, no strings attached.

There is the "Red Cross" (Croix-Rouge). They always need blood.
And going to a Belgian blood drive is an experience.
They give you orange juice and cookies and treat you like a hero.

Volunteering does two things:
1. It helps people. Obviously.
2. It pops the "Expat Bubble."
You meet people you would never meet in the European Quarter.
Refugees, locals, artists, students.
It grounds you. It reminds you that Brussels is a real city with real problems, not just a career stepping stone.
Go do good.
