Day 10. Finding your tribe.
Brussels is incredibly diverse. We have communities from literally everywhere.
Whatever you are into—Coding, Knitting, Salsa, Ultimate Frisbee—there is a group for it here.

There are the big "Expat" machines like InterNations or the Brussels Expedition. These are great for landing.
But then there are the niche groups.
Did you know Brussels has a huge Board Game culture?
And Improv Theatre?
And Toastmasters?

Volunteering is another huge hack for integration.
"Serve the City" is a fantastic organization here. You volunteer for a day—painting a shelter, making sandwiches for refugees—and you meet twenty amazing people who also want to help.
It's the fastest way to make friends with substance.

Don't wait for your social life to happen to you. Go out and design it.
Pick one thing this week. Just one event. Go alone.
It's scary, I know. But everyone else in that room is hoping someone talks to them too.
Be that someone.
