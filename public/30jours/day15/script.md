Day 15. The Glamorous Life of Trash.
I honestly think you need a PhD to understand Belgian recycling.
They take it very, very seriously.
If you put a banana peel in the blue bag, your neighbors will leave a passive-aggressive note on your door.
And the commune might not pick up your trash. Seriously.

So, the colors.
**Blue (PMC):** Plastic bottles, Metals, Drink Cartons.
They recently expanded this! You can now put almooost all plastics in here (yogurt pots, plastic trays).
**Yellow:** Paper and cardboard. Clean cardboard. Not your greasy pizza box.
**White:** The "Residual Waste." Everything you can't recycle.
**Green/Orange:** Food waste. This is mandatory in many communes now.

They collect on specific days.
Do NOT put your bags out the night before if it's windy.
Brussels foxes are real. They will tear your bag open, and you will wake up to your own trash spread across the street.
(I speak from painful experience).

We'll also talk about the "Bulles à verre" (Glass bubbles).
You have to walk your glass bottles to these huge containers on the street.
And please, for the love of God, don't do it at 10 PM. It sounds like a bomb going off. 
Let's sort it out!
