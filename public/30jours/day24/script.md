Day 24. Tribes.
You can't be friends with everyone. And you shouldn't try.
Brussels is a collection of tribes.
You have the **Eurobubble Tribe**. They talk about directives and go to Place Lux.
You have the **Flamingants and Walloons**.
You have the **Artists** in Saint-Gilles.
You have the **Old Money** in Uccle.

To build an inner circle, you need to pick a tribe. Or start your own.
The mistake expats make is trying to fit into the Eurobubble, hating it, and then thinking they hate Brussels.
No. YOU hate slightly overpriced Gin Tonics and conversations about GDPR.
That's fine!
Go find the Board Game tribe. The Salsa tribe. The "I love weird brutalist architecture" tribe.

How?
Be consistent.
Friendship is 50% shared interest and 50% showing up.
Create a "Ritual."
"Every Tuesday, I cook dinner. Who wants to come?"
Start small. Two people.
Then three.
Suddenly, you have a tribe.
Stop waiting to be invited. Be the inviter.
