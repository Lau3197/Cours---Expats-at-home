## Welcome to the Belgian Administration!

Registering at your local **Commune** (municipality) is the single most important administrative step you will take in Belgium. Without it, you cannot legally reside here long-term, open a full bank account, or join a mutuelle (health insurance fund).

### Step 1: Find Your Commune
Brussels is made up of 19 independent communes. You must register at the town hall of the commune where you live.
*   **Ixelles / Elsene**
*   **Saint-Gilles / Sint-Gillis**
*   **Ville de Bruxelles / Stad Brussel** (includes Laeken & Neder-Over-Heembeek)
*   **Etterbeek**
*   ...and [15 others](https://be.brussels/en/about-region/municipalities-brussels).

> **Pro Tip:** Check your postal code. 1050 is Ixelles, 1000 is Brussels City, 1060 is Saint-Gilles.

### Step 2: The Registration Process

The process differs slightly depending on your citizenship, but the core steps are the same:

1.  **Request Registration:** Usually done online via email or the commune's website (IRISbox).
2.  **Submit Documents:** You'll need to upload or present specific documents.
3.  **The Police Visit:** A local police officer will visit your address to confirm you actually live there. They check for your name on the doorbell!
4.  **Order ID Card:** Once the police verify your residence, you'll be invited to order your Belgian ID card.
5.  **Collect ID Card:** 2-3 weeks later, you pick up your card.

### EU Citizens 🇪🇺
You have **3 months** from your arrival to register.
*   **Cost:** ~€15 - €30 (varies by commune).
*   **Outcome:** You will receive an **E Card** (Electronic Residence Card).

### Non-EU Citizens 🌍
You must generally register within **8 days** of arrival.
*   **With D-Visa:** Use your long-stay visa to register.
*   **Without Visa:** If you are applying for residence from within Belgium, the fees are higher (€60–€350+).
*   **Outcome:** You will typically receive an **A Card** (Limited duration) or **B Card** (Unlimited).

### Step 3: The Police Visit (Agent de Quartier)
This is unique to Belgium!
After you apply, a police officer (*Agent de Quartier*) will physically come to your apartment.
*   **Why?** To verify you live where you say you do.
*   **When?** Usually within 1-3 weeks of your application.
*   **What to do?** **PUT YOUR NAME ON THE DOORBELL IMMEDIATELY.** If they can't see your name, they won't ring, and your registration will fail.
