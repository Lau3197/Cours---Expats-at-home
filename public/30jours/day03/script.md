Day 3. Let's talk about your health.
Moving to a new country is stressful, and stress leads to... well, let's just make sure you're covered.

In Belgium, health insurance is **mandatory**. You cannot opt out.
But the system is a bit unique. It's a hybrid system.
You have the "Mutuelle" (or Ziekenfonds) – these are private, non-profit organizations that handle the public reimbursement.
So, you don't sign up with the "government" directly; you sign up with a Mutuelle like Partenamut, CM, Solidaris, or a neutral one like CAAMI.

Here's the golden rule: **Reimbursement**.
In Belgium, you pay the doctor upfront. You pay the full €40, €50, or €60.
Then, you get a "attestation de soins" (a little green paper, or increasingly digital).
You send this to your Mutuelle, and they put money back into your bank account a few days later. Usually about 75%.

Today's mission: Choose your Mutuelle and start the registration.
If you are working, your employer might suggest one. If you are freelancing or looking for work, the choice is 100% yours.
We'll also look at obtaining your national number, because without it, the Mutuelle can't register you.
Let's keep you healthy and insured!
