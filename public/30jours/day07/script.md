Day 7. Congratulations!
You have survived your first week. And honestly, the first week is the hardest.
You've navigated the Commune, set up your bank account, figured out the healthcare maze, started looking for a home, and mastered the metro.
That is massive. Take a moment to breathe.

Today is not about new administration. Today is about **integration**.
It's about taking stock of where you are.
Did you get your "Annex" from the commune?
Is your bank card in the mail?
Have you had your first waffle? (Priorities, right?)

Integration isn't just paperwork. It's feeling like you belong.
So today, your homework is simple: **Enjoy Brussels.**
Go to a park. Sit in a café. Listen to the languages around you.
You live here now. This is your city.
Let's review your progress and get you ready for Week 2, where we dive into the fun stuff: Food, Friends, and Culture.
Bon weekend!
