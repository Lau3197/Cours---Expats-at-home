A comparison table with two distinct columns: 'TU' and 'VOUS'.

**Column 1: TU**
*   **Default:** Friends & Family (as taught in school)
*   **Switching:** When invited by the other person
*   **Cue Phrase:** *"On peut se tutoyer"* ('We can use 'tu' with each other')

**Column 2: VOUS**
*   **Default:** Strangers & Formal Situations (as taught in school)
*   **Recommendation:** Always start with 'vous'
*   **Rationale:** Never rude to be too polite; safe and respectful way to begin any conversation.
*   **Specific Examples:**
    *   Anyone older than you
    *   Teachers
    *   Shopkeepers
    *   Any adult you don't know well
*   **Switching:** The other person will let you know if they want to be less formal.
