A dedicated information panel for 1733. Prominently display the number "1733" as the main title. Below, show "Doctor On-Call Service" and "For Urgent, Non-Life-Threatening Medical Needs" as a subtitle. Include key points: connects to local doctor on-call service; examples include a high fever on a Saturday or needing urgent doctor advice when your GP is closed; the service assesses your situation and advises on going to the Emergency Room (ER) or an on-call GP clinic. Clearly distinguish this as being for *urgent medical advice*, not true life-threatening emergencies (which are for 112).
