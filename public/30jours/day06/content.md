## French… but Belgian style 🇧🇪

Belgian French is distinct from "Metropolitan" (France) French. It is often softer, slower, and yes—logically superior when it comes to numbers.

### The Magic Numbers
France uses a complex math-based system. Belgium keeps it simple.
*   **70:** Septante (Instead of "Soixante-dix")
*   **90:** Nonante (Instead of "Quatre-vingt-dix")
*   **80:** Sadly, we still say "Quatre-vingts" here. We're not perfect.

### Essential Survival Phrases
These are the phrases you will use 80% of the time.
1.  **"S'il vous plaît"** – Means "Please", but in Belgium, it also means "Here you go" when handing something over.
2.  **"Ça va ?"** – The universal key.
    *   *Question:* "Ça va ?" (How are you?)
    *   *Answer:* "Ça va." (I'm good.)
3.  **"Non, ça va."** – No thank you / I'm fine.
4.  **"Excusez-moi"** – To get past someone.
5.  **"Pardon"** – Sorry / I didn't hear you.
6.  **"C'est combien ?"** – How much is it?
7.  **"L'addition, s'il vous plaît."** – The Check, please.

### Belgian Slang (Belgicismes)
*   **"Septante / Nonante"** (70 / 90)
*   **"A tantôt !"** – See you later (used A LOT).
*   **"Une chique"** – Candy / Sweet.
*   **"Kot"** – Student room / small apartment.
*   **"Drache"** – Heavy rain. "Il drache nationale !" (It's pouring!).
*   **"Savoir" vs "Pouvoir"** – Belgians often use *savoir* (to know) instead of *pouvoir* (to be able). *Example: "Tu sais me passer le sel ?" (Can you pass me the salt?)*.

### Greetings (La Bise)
In Brussels, among friends, the standard is **one kiss** on the right cheek.
In professional settings: **Handshake**.
When in doubt? **Wait and see.**
