## Query 1: Brussels commune registration process 2026 documents required

<think>
The user is asking about the Brussels commune registration process in 2026 and the documents required. They're an expat in Brussels. Let me review the search results to provide accurate information about the requirements.

Key information from the search results:

From [1] and [2], I can see the process and requirements differ based on citizenship (EU vs non-EU).

For EU citizens [2]:
- Must register within three months of arrival
- Need: valid passport or ID card, lease contract, proof of health insurance, specific documents depending on status (like employment contract), passport photos
- Small fee (€15-€30 depending on commune)

For non-EU citizens [2]:
- Must register within 8 days of arrival
- Need: valid passport with D-visa, lease contract, ID passport photos
- If already in Brussels without D-visa: need valid passport or Belgian residence permit or EU residence permit, lease contract, certificate of good conduct (not older than 6 months), medical certificate, passport photos, fee €60-€350

From [1] (more detailed):
- Sign up digitally on commune website first
- Upload scan of ID, rental contract, fill in personal data
- Wait for email summons (usually 2-3 weeks)
- Bring: identification, headshot photos on white background, lease contract, work contract
- Appointment time is assigned automatically
- Police visit inspection required after
- Takes approximately 3 weeks after inspection to receive Belgian ID

I should provide a comprehensive answer organized by citizenship status since requirements differ. I need to cite appropriately and avoid repetition.

The Brussels commune registration process requires different documents depending on your citizenship status, but all residents must complete registration to access public services and obtain a residence permit.

## For EU Citizens

**Registration Timeline:** Register within **three months of arrival**[2]

**Required Documents:**
- Valid passport or ID card[2]
- Lease contract[2]
- Proof of health insurance[2]
- Passport photos (typically headshot style on white background)[1]
- Employment contract (if registering as an employee) or specific documents matching your registration status[2]
- Fee: €15–€30 depending on your commune[2]

**Process:** After registering, you'll be listed in the provisional commune register until local police verify your residence address. You'll then receive a **National Register Number (NISS)** — a unique 11-digit identification number[2]. After approximately three months, the commune contacts you to receive your residence permit, available as a free paper document or an E-card (€20, renewed every five years)[2].

## For Non-EU Citizens

**Registration Timeline:** Register within **8 days of arrival**[2]

**Required Documents (with valid D-visa):**
- Valid passport with D-visa from Belgian embassy[2]
- Lease contract[2]
- Passport photos[2]

**Required Documents (without D-visa, if already in Brussels):**
- Valid passport or Belgian/EU residence permit[2]
- Lease contract[2]
- Certificate of good conduct (not older than 6 months)[2]
- Medical certificate[2]
- Passport photos[2]
- Fee: €60–€350[2]

After registration, you'll receive a "declaration of arrival" (valid maximum three months)[2], then an A-Card residence permit within two to three months[2].

## Digital Pre-Registration

Before your in-person appointment, you must register digitally on your commune's website by uploading your ID scan, rental contract, and personal details[1]. The commune then automatically schedules your appointment—you cannot choose the date or time[1]. **Budget approximately 90 minutes to two hours** for your appointment, including potential waiting time[1].

All communes require a police home inspection after registration to verify you live at your declared address[1].

## Query 2: Which Brussels communes have online appointment booking 2026

<think>
The user is asking which Brussels communes have online appointment booking in 2026. Let me look through the search results for specific information about this.

From the search results:

[1] IRISbox - describes it as the electronic service counter for Brussels-Capital Region that allows "Making an appointment with an administration without connexion or via the electronic identity card or Itsme" and mentions it's "Available in all Brussels municipalities" - lists all 19 municipalities.

[2] City of Brussels - mentions MyBXL terminals and PCs for booking appointments

[3] IRISbox appointment page - just shows it's a service available

[4] Brussels Times article - mentions two communes specifically offering English services: "leading to two communes – Etterbeek and Schaerbeek – already offering their services in English" - but this is about language services, not specifically about online appointment booking

[5] Woluwe-Saint-Lambert - mentions appointments "by appointment only" for the Foreigners' Office but doesn't say if online booking is available

[8] MyBXL - City of Brussels portal for pre-booking appointments

The search results indicate that:
- IRISbox is available in all 19 Brussels municipalities and allows online appointment booking
- MyBXL is used by the City of Brussels for appointments
- But the results don't specify which individual communes have online appointment booking beyond these general platforms

I should base my answer on what the search results show - that IRISbox is available across all 19 Brussels municipalities for appointment booking. I should cite appropriately and note any limitations in the information provided.
</think>

**IRISbox offers online appointment booking across all 19 Brussels communes**, as it is the electronic service counter for the entire Brussels-Capital Region[1]. Through IRISbox, citizens can make appointments with administrations without needing a connection or using their electronic identity card or Itsme[1].

The 19 municipalities where IRISbox appointments are available include: Anderlecht, Auderghem, Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Brussels, Etterbeek, Evere, Forest, Ganshoren, Ixelles, Jette, Koekelberg, Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, Saint-Gilles, Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Schaerbeek, Uccle, Watermael-Boitsfort, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, and Woluwe-Saint-Pierre[1].

Additionally, the City of Brussels provides appointment booking through **MyBXL**, its municipal portal, which is also accessible via MyBXL terminals and PCs[2].

Note that while the search results confirm these platforms exist for appointment booking, they don't specify whether all individual communes have fully implemented their own separate online booking systems beyond these regional platforms. For the most current information on appointment availability at a specific commune, you should verify directly with your local municipality or through the IRISbox website.

## Query 3: Belgian residence permit types EU vs non-EU 2026

<think>
The user is asking about Belgian residence permit types for EU vs non-EU citizens in 2026. Let me analyze the search results to provide a comprehensive answer.

From the search results, I can identify:

1. For EU citizens (from result [8]): "For EU citizens, the identity card or a passport is generally sufficient."

2. For non-EU citizens, there are multiple permit types:
- Category A: Temporary residence permit
- Category B: Permanent residence permit (after 5 years)
- Category C/K: mentioned in [7]
- Category D/L: mentioned in [7]
- Category F/F+: mentioned in [7]
- Category H: European Blue Card [7]
- Category M/M+: mentioned in [7]

3. Specific permit types mentioned for non-EU:
- EU Blue Card (H card) - for skilled workers [1] and [7]
- Professional Card - for investors [2]
- Single Permit - for non-European citizens working more than 90 days [5]
- Student residence permit [1]
- Family reunification permits [1], [2]

4. Recent changes: As of September 1, 2025, Belgium updated residence application procedures for EU citizens [9]

5. General path to permanent residence:
- 5 years for EU long-term residence permit [3]
- 5 years with strong work history or 10 years for Belgian settlement permit [3]

I should structure this clearly comparing EU vs non-EU pathways and cite appropriately.
</think>

Belgian residence permit requirements differ significantly between EU and non-EU citizens, with EU citizens enjoying streamlined requirements while non-EU citizens must navigate multiple permit categories.

## EU Citizens

**EU citizens have minimal requirements** – for EU citizens, an identity card or passport is generally sufficient[8]. However, Belgium updated residence application procedures for EU citizens as of September 1, 2025[9], so it's worth verifying current requirements with official Belgian authorities.

After 5 years of uninterrupted legal stay, EU citizens can obtain an **EU long-term residence permit**, which provides permanent residency without constant permit renewal[3].

## Non-EU Citizens

Non-EU citizens must obtain a specific residence permit based on their purpose of stay. The main types include:

**Temporary residence permits (Category A):** The most common type for non-EU immigrants. Usually issued for one year but valid up to three years with renewal possibilities[1]. Category A permits count toward naturalization after 5 years of total residence.

**Permanent residence permits (Category B):** Available after 5 years of continuous residence on a temporary immigration-type permit, provided total absence doesn't exceed 10 months (or 6 months consecutively) during that period[1].

**Work-related permits:**
- **Single permit:** For non-European citizens working in Belgium for more than 90 days[5]
- **EU Blue Card (H card):** For skilled workers earning at least 130% of the regional average salary (approximately €60,000-65,000 annually in 2024)[1][7]
- **Professional Card:** For self-employed individuals and investors, valid up to 5 years with extension possibilities based on business profitability[2]

**Other permit types:**
- **Student residence permits:** Usually issued for one year with renewal rights, though residence time counts as only 50% toward naturalization[1]
- **Family reunification permits:** For spouses, registered partners, and children of Belgian or legally residing foreigners, issued for the duration of the sponsor's permit with renewal options[1][2]

**Settlement options:** Non-EU citizens can obtain a **Belgian settlement permit** (permanent residency) after 5 years with strong work history or 10 years in other cases[3].

Belgium does **not grant residence permits** for financially independent persons, retirees, or investors based on passive income alone[1], unlike some other EU countries.

## Query 4: Commune registration fees Brussels 2026

<think>
The user is asking about commune registration fees in Brussels for 2026. Let me look through the search results for this information.

From search result [2] (Brussels Times article from September 2025):
"A small fee, ranging from €15 to €30 depending on the commune, will also be charged."

This is about EU citizen registration at the commune.

For non-EU citizens, the same source states:
"This costs between €60 and €350, depending on the country" - but this refers to the D-visa fee from the embassy/consulate.

And later: "you must also pay a fee between €60 and €350" - this appears to be for the residence permit application if they arrive without a D-visa.

Search result [5] mentions "a fee linked to this procedure is higher (between 110 EUR and 150 EUR)" but doesn't clearly specify what this is for.

Search result [4] mentions that "For certain categories of foreigners, a proof of payment of a federal tax (fee) is required" but doesn't give specific amounts.

So the clearest information I have is:
- EU citizens: €15 to €30 depending on the commune (for basic registration)
- Non-EU citizens: Various fees ranging from €60 to €350 depending on circumstances and country

The information about EU citizen commune registration fees (€15-€30) appears to be current as of September 2025, and there's no indication it changed for 2026. The fees mentioned in [1] about Belgian immigration are "contribution fees" for residence applications (D-visa processing), which are different from commune registration fees.

I should provide both EU and non-EU information with proper citations.
</think>

**Commune registration fees in Brussels for 2026 are €15 to €30 for EU citizens and €60 to €350 for non-EU citizens**, depending on the commune and individual circumstances.

For **EU citizens**, registration at the commune costs a small fee ranging from €15 to €30, which varies by commune.[2] EU citizens must register within three months of arrival as an employed or self-employed person, job seeker, or family member.[2]

For **non-EU citizens**, the fee structure is more complex and depends on your entry status:

- If you obtained a **D-visa (long-term visa) from the Belgian Embassy or consulate before arriving**, the visa itself costs between €60 and €350 depending on your country.[2]

- If you arrive in Brussels without a D-visa and request a long-term residence permit directly from the commune, you must pay a fee between €60 and €350.[2]

Beyond commune registration, be aware that Belgium's **immigration contribution fees for residence applications were indexed upward on 1 January 2026**, with increases ranging from €4 to €11 per file depending on the application type.[1] For example, the fee for highly-skilled employees rose to €377.[1]

**Important note:** Fees may vary slightly by commune and circumstances. Contact your specific Brussels commune directly to confirm exact amounts before registration, as these fees can change.
