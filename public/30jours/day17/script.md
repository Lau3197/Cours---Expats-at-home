Day 17. The Road.
Whether you drive a car, a bike, or a scooter, you need to know one rule.
One rule to rule them all.
**"Priorité à Droite."** (Priority to the Right).

This is the rule that causes the most accidents for expats.
Here it is: If you are at an intersection, and there are NO signs (and no traffic lights), the car coming from your RIGHT has priority.
Even if they are coming out of a tiny street.
Even if you are on a "bigger" road.
If you don't stop, you are in the wrong.
It's terrifying, but you get used to it. You have to slow down at every unchecked junction.

We also talk about licenses.
If you are EU, your license is fine.
If you are Non-EU (hello Americans, Brits, Canadians), you usually have to **exchange** your license for a Belgian one within 6 months.
Do not miss this deadline. If you miss it, you might have to retake the test.
And trust me, you do not want to take the Belgian driving test. It involves hazing rituals. (Okay, not really, but it's hard).

And finally: Parking.
Blue Zones (Disque), Red Zones, Green Zones.
We'll decode the color map so you don't get towed.
Drive safe!
