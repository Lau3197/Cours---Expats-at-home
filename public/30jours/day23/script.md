Day 23. The Dip.
There is a graph of expat happiness.
It goes up at the start (Honeymoon!).
Then it crashes. (The Dip).
Then it slowly goes up again (Adjustment).
You might be in The Dip right now.
Missing your mom's cooking. Missing your old friends who "just get it."
Missing a time zone where you don't have to do math to call someone.

Homesickness is physical. It hurts.
My advice?
Don't fight it.
Schedule a "Home Day."
Eat food from your country. Watch TV from your country. Cry if you want.
It's a detox.
But then... set a timer. 24 hours.
After that, you have to go out.

You need to build your "Brussels Family."
Friends who become family.
Every expat here gets it. We are all orphans of our homelands.
Reach out. Say: "I'm having a tough day."
Someone will say: "Me too. Let's get a beer."
And that's how you survive.
