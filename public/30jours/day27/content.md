## Developing a "Brussels Heart" ❤️

Brussels has a lot of NGOs and charities. Finding one that fits your schedule is key.

### English-Friendly Opportunities
1.  **Serve the City:**
    *   *What:* The gold standard for English-speaking expats.
    *   *Activities:* Serving breakfast to refugees (Porte d'Ulysse), visiting elderly homes, street cleaning.
    *   *Commitment:* Very flexible. Register for single events via their app "ServeNow".
2.  **Community Help Service (CHS):**
    *   *What:* 24/7 Helpline in English.
    *   *Role:* They train volunteers to answer calls from people in crisis.
    *   *Commitment:* Requires training and commitment. Serious but impactful.
3.  **RefuInterim / BxlRefugees:**
    *   *What:* Humanitarian Hub at Maximilien Park / Gare du Nord.
    *   *Role:* Sorting clothes, preparing food packets.

### The "Citizen" Actions
You don't need an NGO to help.
*   **The "Frigo Solidaire" (Solidarity Fridge):** Some neighborhoods have fridges on the street where you can leave leftovers/food for those in need.
*   **Blood Donation (Rode Kruis / Croix-Rouge):** Brussels is often short on blood stocks.
    *   *Donor Center:* Rue de la Regence (near Sablon). Walk-ins welcome.

### Why It Matters
Expats often complain about "Dirty Brussels" or "Homelessness."
Volunteering changes your perspective from "Critic" to "Contributor."
It is the fastest way to stop feeling like a tourist.
