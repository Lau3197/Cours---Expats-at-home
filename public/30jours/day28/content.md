## The Path to Citizenship 🇧🇪

Belgium has one of the most accessible citizenship tracks in Europe.
If you plan to stay, this should be your long-term goal.

### The "Short Track" (5 Years)
You can apply for nationality after 5 years if you meet these criteria:
1.  **Residence:** 5 years of legal, continuous residence (registered at the Commune).
2.  **Language:** Proof of **A2 level** in French or Dutch.
    *   *Proof:* A language course certificate, or a Belgian diploma.
3.  **Social Integration:**
    *   A diploma (Bachelor/Master) obtained in Belgium.
    *   OR a specialized "Integration Course" (Citoyenneté) provided by the commune.
    *   OR having worked continuously for 5 years.
4.  **Economic Participation:**
    *   Worked for at least 468 days (full-time equivalent) in the last 5 years.

### The "Documentation" Habit
Bureaucracy loves paper.
Start a **"Citizenship Folder"** (physical or digital).
*   Save every **Tax Assessment** (Avertissement-Extrait de Rôle).
*   Save every **Attestation of Work** from employers.
*   Save your **Language Certificates**.
*   Save proof of **Rent Payment**.

### Why do it?
*   **EU Rights:** Freedom to live/work anywhere in the EU.
*   **Voting:** Vote in Federal elections.
*   **Stability:** No more renewing residence cards.

> **Note:** Rules change. Always check with your commune or a lawyer when you get closer to the 5-year mark.
