## Building Your Brussels Ecosystem 🌿

Integration isn't about big events. It's about small, repeated actions.

### The "Third Place" Concept
You have Home (1st place) and Work (2nd place). You need a 3rd place.
*   **The Local Café:** Bring a book. Don't look at your phone. Become a "regular" (un habitué).
*   **The Park:** Use the same bench. Watch the same dogs.
*   **The Gym/Club:** Shared suffering builds bonds.

### A Typical "Local" Week
Structure helps you feel grounded.
*   **Monday:** Quiet night. Grocery shopping at Colruyt/Delhaize.
*   **Tuesday:** Sport / Hobby. (Padel is huge in Brussels right now).
*   **Wednesday:** Market day? (Place du Châtelain is the place to be seen).
*   **Thursday:** **Jeudi Apero.** The big night out. Everyone is at a bar.
*   **Friday:** Dinner with friends or cinema.
*   **Saturday:** Shopping, errands, museums.
*   **Sunday:** Brunch. Slow walk in the forest (Bois de la Cambre). Family lunch.

### Embracing "Quartier" Loyalty
People in Brussels are very proud of their commune.
"I'm a Saint-Gillois." "I'm from Etterbeek."
Get to know your local shopkeepers.
Greeting the baker with a cheerful *"Bonjour !"* is mandatory.
Leaving without saying *"Merci, au revoir !"* is a crime.
These micro-interactions build your social web.
