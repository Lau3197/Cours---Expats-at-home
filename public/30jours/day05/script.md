Day 5! Let's get moving.
Brussels traffic can be... challenging. But the public transport? It's actually pretty great.
The network is run by STIB (Société des Transports Intercommunaux de Bruxelles) or MIVB in Dutch.

You need one thing: The **MOBIB Card**.
It's your contactless key to the city.
You can put single tickets on it, but if you live here, you want the Subscription.
For just under €55 a month (or drastically less if you're a student!), you get unlimited access to all buses, trams, and metros in Brussels.
Wait, there's more!
The **Brupass XL** zone allows you to also take the TRAINS (SNCB) inside and around Brussels.
It's a cheat code. Taking the train from Boitsfort to Schuman takes 12 minutes. The tram takes 35 coverage.

We'll also talk about the apps you need.
Google Maps is okay, but "Citymapper" or the official "STIB Mobile" app are much better for real-time updates.
And for the brave? We'll talk about cycling rules. Villo bikes, Bolt scooters, and the "Right of Way from the Right" rule that terrifies everyone.
Let's ride!
