## Financial Foundations: Your Belgian Bank Account

Securing a Belgian bank account is step #2 in your integration. While EU IBAN discrimination is illegal, having a "BE" IBAN eliminates friction with local utility providers, health insurance refunds, and salary payments.

### The Landscape: Traditional vs. Neobanks

| Feature | KBC / ING / BNP (Traditional) | N26 / Revolut / Bunq (Neobanks) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | €2 - €5 / month | Free - €10 / month |
| **Physical Branches** | Yes (Helpful for issues) | No (App only) |
| **Rental Guarantee** | **Required** (They offer this service) | Usually No |
| **Payconiq Support** | Yes (Native integration) | No (Often rarely supported) |
| **Expat Friendliness** | High (KBC especially) | High (English first) |

### Top Recommendation: KBC Brussels
For most expats, **KBC Brussels** is the top choice because:
1.  **English-first App**: Voted best banking app in the world multiple times.
2.  **Expat Service**: They understand you might not have an ID card yet (you can start with a passport).
3.  **Rental Guarantees**: They handle the blocked account for your apartment deposit easily.

### The "Rental Guarantee" (Garantie Locative)
This is crucial. In Belgium, you do **not** send your deposit to your landlord.
Instead, you open a **Locked Blocked Account** in your name.
*   You put the money in (usually 2 months' rent).
*   The bank locks it.
*   It sits there earning tiny interest.
*   It is only released when you move out (with signature of both you and landlord).
**Do not transfer cash to a landlord directly unless absolutely necessary!**

### How to Open an Account
1.  **Online:** Most banks (KBC, ING) allow you to start the application online 24/7.
2.  **Documents:** Upload scans of your ID/Passport.
3.  **Verification:** Video call or small transfer from another account.
4.  **Card Delivery:** Your card and PIN arrive separately by mail within 3-5 days.

### Important: Payconiq
Belgium runs on an app called **Payconiq**. It's used to pay friends back for dinner, buy swift drinks at a bar, or pay in small shops.
You need a Belgian bank account to use Payconiq fully. It's a lifesaver!
