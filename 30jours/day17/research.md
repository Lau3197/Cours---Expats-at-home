Belgium has **10 official nationwide public holidays** in 2026.[1] These are:

- New Year's Day (Thursday, 1 January)[1]
- Easter Monday (Monday, 6 April)[1]
- Labour Day (Friday, 1 May)[1]
- Ascension Day (Thursday, 14 May)[1]

- All Saints' Day (Sunday, 1 November)[1]
- Armistice Day (Wednesday, 11 November)[1]

## Long Weekends

The best extended breaks form around **Labour Day (1 May)**, **Ascension Day (14 May)**, **Whit Monday (25 May)**, and **Christmas Day (25 December)**.[1] Ascension Day is often extended into a four-day weekend, while Whit Monday naturally creates a long break for early summer travel.[1] During these periods, accommodation prices rise and transport services fill quickly, particularly on routes between Brussels, Bruges, Ghent, and Antwerp.[1]

## Regional and Bank Holidays

Beyond national holidays, Belgium has **regional public holidays** depending on where you live:[4]

- **Brussels-Capital:** Iris Day (8 May)
- **Flanders:** Day of the Flemish Community (11 July)
- **Wallonia:** Day of the Walloon Region (20 September) and Day of the French Community (27 September)
- **German-speaking areas:** Day of the German-speaking Community (15 November)

Additionally, **Good Friday (3 April)** and **Boxing Day (26 December)** are bank holidays where many businesses close.[2][4]
