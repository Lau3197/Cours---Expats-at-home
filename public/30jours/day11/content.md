## Mastering the Belgian Workplace

Working in Belgium is distinct from the US or UK styles. It values stability, compromise, and strict separation of work/life.

### The "Belgian Compromise"
Belgians dislike conflict. In meetings, you rarely see shouting matches or aggressive sales tactics.
*   **The Goal:** Consensus.
*   **The Process:** Long discussions where everyone gives input.
*   **The Result:** A slow decision, but one that everyone sticks to.
*   **Advice:** Be patient. Don't push too hard, too fast. Building coalition is key.

### Hierarchy & Formality
*   **Titles:** Use "Monsieur" / "Madame" until invited to use first names (though startups are more casual).
*   **Kissing:** In French-speaking offices, colleagues (often even men/women) kiss on the cheek (la bise) to say hello in the morning. **Post-Covid:** Handshakes or waves are safer and widely accepted. Read the room.

### Work-Life Balance
*   **Hours:** 9 AM - 5:30 PM is standard. Overtime is discouraged unless paid or recovered.
*   **Lunch:** Sacred. 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM. Taking a break is seen as healthy, not lazy.
*   **Right to Disconnect:** It is illegal for bosses to demand emails be answered after hours (in companies with 20+ employees).

### Salaries & Indexation
*   **The 13.92 Months:** Most Belgians are paid 13.92 times a year.
    *   **Month 13:** End-of-year bonus.
    *   **The 0.92:** "Double Holiday Pay" (Double Pécule de Vacances) paid in May/June for your summer holiday.
*   **Indexation:** Salaries are automatically adjusted for inflation. If the cost of living goes up 2%, your salary goes up 2%. Automatically. It's amazing.

### Taxes (The Pain Point)
Belgium has some of the highest taxes on labor in the world.
*   **Expectation:** Your Net will be significantly lower than your Gross.
*   **Perks:** To compensate, employers give "Optimized Salary Packages" instead of cash:
    *   Company Car / Fuel Card
    *   Meal Vouchers (Chèques-Repas)
    *   Eco-Vouchers
    *   Hospitalization Insurance
