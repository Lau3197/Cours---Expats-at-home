**Visual Structure:** A central, prominent title `Week 3: Connect`. This title is integrated into a dynamic visual representation that progresses from an initial state of individual focus or basic tasks (subtly implying 'surviving' from previous weeks) to a state of flourishing interaction and community.

**Specific Information:** The graphic illustrates the core idea of "connecting" by showing diverse figures (e.g., distinct icons representing expats, locals, or people with shared hobbies) forming links, networks, or gathering together. The overall visual tone should convey the transition from 'surviving' to 'thriving' through these connections, symbolizing "finding your people" and "building a social life."
