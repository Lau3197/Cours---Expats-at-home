A detailed illustration representing 'Direct Debits' (Domiciliation). The central element should be a bank account or a bank card. From this central element, multiple recurring payment arrows flow outwards to distinct icons representing common recurring bills: a house (for rent), a Wi-Fi symbol (for internet), a phone icon (for phone bills), and a lightning bolt (for electricity). Each arrow should visibly incorporate a repeating cycle or a calendar element, and a Euro sign, to signify automated monthly payments that are set up once.
