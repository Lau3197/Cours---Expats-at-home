Day 9. Let's talk about the people.
There's a saying: "A Belgian is born with a brick in his stomach."
It means we love building houses. But it also means we build walls.
Belgians are reserved. We don't do the "Hey! How are you! Let's handle hugs!" thing immediately.
We are like coconuts. Hard on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside.
The Americans? They are peaches. Soft on the outside, hard pit in the middle. (Sorry, Americans).

Making friends here takes **time**. It is not personal. It is cultural.
We prioritize quality over quantity. Once you have a Belgian friend, you have a friend for life.
So how do you crack the coconut?
1. **Join a club.** Sport, art, theatre. We bond over *doing* things together.
2. **Be the organizer.** Don't wait for invitations. Host a dinner. Invite colleagues for a drink ("un verre").
3. **Learn the language.** Even a little bit. It shows respect, and respect is the currency of friendship here.

Don't stay in the "Expat Bubble." It's comfortable, but it's transient.
Meet the locals. We're actually quite nice once you get to know us.
And yes, we will eventually invite you to our homes. But maybe not in the first week.
Patience is key.
