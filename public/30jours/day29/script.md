Day 29. The Playbook.
We are almost at the end.
Today is about the Hacks. The secrets.
The things locals know but don't tell you.

1. **The Toilet Pass.** In Brussels, you always have to pay for toilets. 50 cents.
Key hack: Walk into any nice hotel. Act confident. Use the lobby bathroom. Free and clean.
2. **Too Good To Go.** The app. Bakeries give away bags of pastries at 6 PM for €3. It's dangerous for your waistline, but great for your wallet.
3. **Museum Pass.** €59 for a year. 200 museums. If you go to 4 museums, it's paid for.
4. **Villo!** The city bikes. The first 30 mins are free.
Ride for 29 mins. Dock it. Wait 2 mins. Take it again. Free ride across the city.
5. **Water.** Tap water is safe. But restaurants will try to sell you bottled "Chaudfontaine."
Ask for "Une carafe d'eau" (A jug of water). They might say no (it's legal to say no here!), but more places are accepting it.

Brussels is a game. Play it well.
