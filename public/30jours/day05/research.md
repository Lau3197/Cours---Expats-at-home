## Query 1: STIB MOBIB card prices 2026

<think>
The user is asking about STIB MOBIB card prices for 2026. Let me look at the search results provided.

From the search results:

[2] provides the most current pricing information for MOBIB cards:
- One-way ticket: € 2.40 (valid for 60 minutes with unlimited transfers)
- 10-journey ticket: € 16.80
- MOBIB basic card: € 6
- 1-day unlimited travel pass: € 9.50
- Monthly pass: € 55.50
- Annual pass: € 660 (for Brupass)

[1] is from October 2020, so it's outdated about a price raise.

[3] mentions the MOBIB card costs €6 and is valid for 5 years.

[4] is about the app.

[5] mentions €12 per year for students 18-24.

[6] is about NMBS/SNCB Jump tickets, not STIB MOBIB.

The most relevant and current pricing information comes from source [2], which appears to be from Introducing Brussels and has the ticket pricing structure.

However, I should note that the search results don't explicitly state they are from 2026 or the most recent 2026 prices. The user is asking for 2026 prices, and today is January 4, 2026. The information in [2] seems to be the most current available in the search results, but I should acknowledge if the pricing might have changed or if this is the most current information available.

Let me structure the answer:
1. Direct answer with key prices
2. Supporting details about the MOBIB card system
3. Note about whether this is current for 2026

I need to cite appropriately.
</think>

The current STIB **MOBIB card prices** are: a basic card costs **€6**[2], with a one-way ticket at **€2.40** (valid for 60 minutes with unlimited transfers)[2], a **10-journey ticket at €16.80**[2], a **monthly pass at €55.50**[2], and a **1-day unlimited travel pass at €9.50**[2].

The **MOBIB basic card is valid for 5 years**[3], making it a reusable smart card for the STIB/MIVB network. All tickets can be purchased at any metro station or city newsstand[2]. You can also reload and manage your MOBIB card through the official STIB-MIVB app[4].

For those traveling in the wider region, the **Brupass** offers slightly different pricing: a 10-journey pass at **€18.90** or a **€56 monthly pass**, and it covers STIB plus regional networks like TEC, De Lijn, and SNCB trains within Brussels[2].

If you're a student aged 18-24 officially living or studying in Brussels, you qualify for a heavily discounted **annual school season ticket at €12**[5].

**Important note:** The search results available do not explicitly confirm whether these prices have changed since January 2026 began. For the most current pricing in 2026, you may want to verify directly with STIB or check their official website, as public transport fares can change periodically.

## Query 2: Brussels public transport subscription expats 2026

<think>
The user is asking about Brussels public transport subscriptions for expats in 2026. Let me analyze the search results to provide relevant, practical information.

From the search results:
1. There's a €12/year metro, tram, and bus ticket for students aged 18-24
2. STIB (or MIVB in French) manages the metro, tram, and bus in Brussels
3. The MoBIB card is the payment system for public transport
4. According to the video transcript, a monthly pass for STIB is €55/month for adults (after recent price increase)
5. Various seasonal tickets are available depending on age and situation
6. Students under 26 get 80% discount on train tickets
7. Seniors (65+) get discounts
8. Public transport is valid for 60 minutes across all modes

Key information for expats:
- The main payment method is the MoBIB card
- Monthly subscription is €55 for adults
- STIB operates metro, tram, and bus in Brussels
- Different rates for students, seniors, etc.
- The system is unified across Belgium with regional variations

I should be clear about:
1. The current monthly pass cost (€55)
2. What the MoBIB card is
3. Different pricing options
4. The operators
5. Practical information for expats

Let me structure this clearly with proper citations.
</think>

**Public transport subscriptions in Brussels are managed by STIB (Société des Transports Intercommunaux de Bruxelles) and use the MoBIB card system for payment.**

## Monthly and Annual Options

A **monthly pass for adults costs €55 per month** and provides unlimited travel on the metro, tram, and bus network within Brussels[4]. The **MoBIB card is the standard payment method** accepted across all public transport in Belgium[3].

Alternatively, you can purchase seasonal tickets lasting from one month to a full year, depending on your situation[3]. Students under 26 receive an 80% discount on train season tickets[3], and there's a special €12 per year option for students aged 18-24 with a school attestation who are domiciled in Brussels[1].

## How the System Works

A single ticket or pass is valid for 60 minutes of continuous travel, allowing you to change between metro, tram, and bus services without purchasing additional tickets[3]. You can buy tickets at stations, kiosks, on buses, or online using your MoBIB card[3].

## Which Operators to Use

**STIB/MIVB operates the metro, tram, and bus** within Brussels[2]. If you travel beyond Brussels to neighboring areas, De Lijn covers Flanders connections, TEC covers Wallonia, and SNCB operates regional trains[2].

## Pricing Updates

Note that fares have been indexed recently, with increases effective from February 2025[5], so prices may adjust further during 2026. It's worth checking the STIB website directly for current rates if you're planning your move.

## Query 3: Exchange driving license Belgium 2026

<think>
The user is asking about exchanging a driving license in Belgium in 2026. This is a practical question for expats living in Belgium. Let me analyze the search results to provide current, accurate information.

Key information from the search results:
1. The process and timeline depends on whether the license is EU or non-EU
2. EU licenses (paper or older format): must be exchanged within 2 years of registration in Belgium
3. Non-EU licenses: must be exchanged within 185 days of registration in Belgium
4. UK licenses are treated as non-EU licenses due to Brexit
5. The process takes 4-6 weeks
6. Cost is approximately €25-€30 in most municipalities, but can range from €10-€64
7. Required documents typically include: original license, ID/residence permit, passport photo, and translation if needed
8. Must apply at local commune/municipality

Since the current date is January 4, 2026, I should note that the search results reference events up to July 1, 2025 (regarding T driving licenses). The information should still be current for 2026.

I need to structure this clearly for expats:
- Direct answer about the exchange requirement
- EU vs non-EU differences
- Timeline requirements
- Documents needed
- Costs
- Process

I should cite appropriately and avoid being redundant.
</think>

To exchange a foreign driving license in Belgium, the timeline and requirements depend on whether your license is from an **EU country or a non-EU country**.[1]

## EU License Holders

**Paper licenses, older bank card formats without expiry dates, or licenses valid for over 15 years must be exchanged within two years of registering in Belgium.** All other EU credit card format licenses must be exchanged at least three months before expiry.[1] If you don't exchange within the two-year window, you risk fines during roadside checks.[1]

## Non-EU License Holders

**Non-EU licenses (including UK licenses post-Brexit) must be exchanged within 185 days of registering in Belgium.** After this period, you are no longer entitled to drive in Belgium.[1][2] If your license is not yet valid or has expired, you cannot use it to apply for exchange.

## Required Documents

For both EU and non-EU licenses, bring to your local commune:[1][3]

- Original driving license (valid and in good condition)
- Belgian ID card or residence permit
- Recent passport photo (maximum 6 months old, meeting ICAO standards)
- **Translation by a sworn translator** if your license is not in French, Dutch, or English

## Timeline and Cost

The process takes **four to six weeks** and costs approximately **€25–€30**, though some municipalities charge up to €64.[2][3] Your original license will not be returned.[2]

**Important:** Contact your local commune soon to confirm the exact procedure, as requirements can vary by municipality and applications are handled individually.[1]
