Day 19. Love in the time of rain.
Dating in Brussels is... interesting.
You have the "Eurocrats" who move every 3 years.
You have the Belgians who have had the same friends since kindergarten.
And you have the "Brussels Mix" - the creative, chaotic middle ground.

Belgian dating culture is low-key.
We don't really "date." We just... hang out? And then suddenly we are married?
It's confusing.
Key tips:
1. **Don't brag.** American-style confidence comes off as arrogance here. Be humble.
2. **Split the bill.** It's 2026. Equality is sexy.
3. **Punctuality.** If you are late for a date, you are telling them you don't respect them.
4. **The "Exclusive" talk.** We don't really have it. If you are kissing regularly, it's generally assumed you aren't seeing others. But ask if unsure!

Apps? Tinder, Bumble, Hinge. The usual suspects.
But the best way? House parties.
If you get invited to a house party, GO. That is where the magic happens.
Good luck out there!
