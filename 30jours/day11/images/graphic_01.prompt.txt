**Visual Structure:** Detailed illustration of a dynamic, modern Belgian office environment.

**Content:** The illustration depicts a bright, open-plan office space with large windows revealing a subtle Brussels cityscape. Within this professional yet inviting setting, various interactions highlight Belgian workplace culture:

1.  **Hierarchy & Formality:** In one area, a new employee is shown respectfully greeting a senior manager, implying the use of formal titles like "Monsieur" or "Madame," with the manager's demeanor suggesting a professional boundary that might later evolve to first-name usage.
2.  **Peer Informality:** Nearby, colleagues at the same level are depicted collaborating casually, exchanging ideas freely and informally, using first names.
3.  **Consensus & Meetings:** In a meeting room or collaborative zone, several team members are actively engaged in a discussion, with multiple participants sharing their opinions. A manager facilitates the conversation, ensuring all input is heard and contributing to a thorough, consensus-driven process that can sometimes make meetings feel longer.
The overall atmosphere conveys a blend of structured professionalism and collaborative openness.
