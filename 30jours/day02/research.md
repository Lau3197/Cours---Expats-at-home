## Query 1: Best banks for expats Brussels 2026 comparison

<think>
The user is asking for a comparison of the best banks for expats in Brussels in 2026. The current date is January 4, 2026, which is actually relevant since one of the search results mentions pricing "from 01-01-2026" for KBC.

Let me analyze the search results to provide a comprehensive comparison of the best banks for expats in Brussels.

Key banks mentioned:
1. KBC/KBC Brussels - Best bank in Belgium (ranked 6 times), good for expats
2. ING - Low fees, expat facilities, English resources
3. BNP Paribas Fortis - Largest bank by assets, expat-friendly
4. Belfius - Largest by number of branches
5. Wise - Not a bank but payment institution, good for multi-currency
6. Hello bank! - Online bank owned by BNP Paribas
7. N26 - Mobile bank with free accounts
8. Nickel - Subsidiary of BNP Paribas

For Brussels specifically, the user should note:
- KBC Brussels (since they're in Brussels/Flanders area)
- If in Wallonia, CBC is better
- BNP Paribas Fortis has extensive network
- ING is one of the big 4 banks

I should structure this with a direct answer first, then a comparison table or details about key options for expats in Brussels.

I'll cite the search results appropriately using the [1][2] format, etc.
</think>

The **best banks for expats in Brussels** are **KBC Brussels**, **ING**, and **BNP Paribas Fortis**, each offering distinct advantages depending on your needs and financial priorities.

| Bank | Monthly Fee | Key Benefits | Best For |
|------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **KBC Brussels** | €4.25 (Plus Account) | 6x ranked best bank in Belgium; online account opening; free switching service; credit + 2 debit cards[5] | Expats wanting established bank reputation and convenience |
| **ING** | €1.90 (lowest among major banks) | One of Belgium's big 4; free for under-26s; English resources; liability insurance[1][2] | Budget-conscious expats; younger professionals |
| **BNP Paribas Fortis** | €3/month (Comfort Pack, up to 3 accounts) | Largest by assets; 700+ branches; 3,700 ATMs; under-18 welcome pack available[1][3] | Families; those needing extensive branch network |

## Key Considerations for Brussels

**KBC Brussels** is specifically designed for expats in Brussels and allows you to open an account entirely online from abroad, though you must visit a branch in person to sign for your debit card upon arrival[5]. The account includes a credit card, two debit cards, online banking, and Apple Pay[5].

**ING** provides facilities specifically designed for expats with many resources available in English, plus services like liability insurance and blocked rental guarantee accounts[1].

**All major banks** open between 9:00-17:30 (sometimes closing for lunch) and offer services in French, Dutch, and English[2].

## Alternative Options

For **multi-currency management**, **Wise** (not a traditional bank but an authorized payment institution) offers transparent international transfer fees using mid-market exchange rates and can hold over 40 currencies—particularly valuable if you receive income in multiple currencies[2][3].

**Hello bank!** (owned by BNP Paribas Fortis) provides digital-only banking if you prefer online-only operations[6].

When choosing, consider your primary needs: establishing bank reputation (KBC), lowest fees (ING), branch accessibility (BNP Paribas Fortis), or multi-currency transactions (Wise alongside your Belgian account).

## Query 2: Open bank account Belgium required documents 2026

<think>
The user is asking about the required documents to open a bank account in Belgium in 2026. They want current information relevant to expats.

Let me analyze the search results:

1. From [1] N26: National ID or passport, proof of address (utility bill or rental contract)
2. From [2] LiveInBelgium: Proof of residence is compulsory; can use Orange Card or Declaration of Legal Cohabitation
3. From [3] Wise: Valid passport or Belgian ID card; proof of residence (utility bill or rental contract)
4. From [4] Expatica: Proof of identity (passport or ID card) and proof of address
5. From [5] Wise: Proof of identity and address outside Belgium
6. From [7] TheBulletin: Proof of identity, attestation from employer

All sources consistently mention the same basic requirements. I should provide a clear, concise answer with the main documents needed, and note variations based on whether someone is a resident or non-resident.

Key points:
- Basic requirement: ID (passport or national ID) + proof of address
- For residents: Utility bill, rental contract, or residence permit card
- For non-residents: May need proof of home country address
- Optional: Income statement, employer attestation

I should keep this clear and practical for expats.
</think>

To open a bank account in Belgium, you need **proof of identity** (passport or national ID card) and **proof of address**.[1][3][4]

## Essential Documents

- **Passport or national ID card**[1][3]
- **Proof of residence** — typically a utility bill or rental contract[1][3]

## For Residents with Belgian Permits

If you have a Belgian residence permit, you can use your permit card as proof of address.[2] You can also request a letter of residence from your local Gemeentehuis (town hall) or Stadhuis if needed.[2]

## For Non-Residents

If you don't yet have a Belgian address, you'll need to provide **proof of your home country address** and demonstrate an economic link to Belgium (such as employment or business reasons).[1][5] Non-residents often cannot open accounts online and must visit a bank branch in person.[5]

## Optional Supporting Documents

While not always required, providing additional documents can streamline the process:[1]
- Income statement or proof of employment
- Employer attestation[7]

## Account Opening Methods

Most Belgian banks allow you to open accounts either **online** (with document upload or video verification) or **in person** at a branch.[1][4] Online banks like N26 typically have faster processes and may require minimal documentation beyond ID and address verification.[1]

**Note:** Specific requirements vary between banks, so confirm with your chosen bank before applying.[1][5] Many banks in Belgium offer English-speaking customer service for expats.[1][3]

I need to be careful to cite properly and not leave spaces before citations.
</think>

Both **N26** and **bunq** are popular digital banks for expats in Belgium, each with distinct strengths depending on your needs.

**Bank Basics**

N26 is a German-based mobile bank known for its sleek app and extensive global reach across Europe and the US[2]. Bunq is a Dutch-based bank renowned for innovative features and sustainability commitments[2]. Both offer free accounts, contactless payments, and mobile wallets[2], and both are regulated with deposit protection up to €100,000[4].

**Pricing Comparison**

N26 offers five personal plans ranging from free to €16.90/month (Metal)[1]. Bunq offers four plans: Free, Core (€3.99/month), Pro (€9.99/month), and Elite (€18.99/month)[3].

**Key Differences for Expats**

| Feature | N26 | Bunq |
|---------|-----|------|
| Savings Interest | 1.3% on lower tiers | 3.36% on free plan |
| Physical Card | Not in free plan; included in premium plans | Not in free plan; €99 per card on higher tiers |
| Multi-currency | Strong feature; free worldwide withdrawals | Multi-currency accounts available |
| Passport Acceptance | More restrictive | Accepts more passport types[7] |
| Best For | Frequent travelers | Sustainability-focused, businesses |

**For Belgium Expats Specifically**

An important consideration: bunq **accepts more passport types**, making it potentially easier for expats with non-EU passports to open an account[7]. N26 excels for frequent travelers with free worldwide cash withdrawals and multiple currency management[2]. If you're looking for the best savings rates, bunq's free plan offers significantly higher interest (3.36%) compared to N26's 1.3%[1].

Choose based on your priorities: N26 for travel flexibility, bunq for broader passport acceptance and better savings rates.
