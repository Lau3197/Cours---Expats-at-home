Day 30. We made it.
Take a deep breath.
You are still here.
You navigated the commune. You opened a bank account. You sorted your trash (mostly).
You learned to say "Nonante."
You are a Brusseleir.

Brussels is a tough city to love at first.
It's complicated. It's messy.
But it rewards those who stay.
You are now part of the fabric of this city.
The next time you see a lost tourist looking at a map, help them.
Pay it forward.

This course is over, but your life here is just starting.
Go out there.
Eat the waffle.
Drink the beer.
Hug your friends.
And don't forget your umbrella.

Welcome home.
Au revoir ! Tot ziens !
