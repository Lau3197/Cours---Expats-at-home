Bonjour and welcome to Day 1 of your 30-Day Brussels Integration Course!
I'm so excited you're here. Today, we're tackling the absolute most critical first step of your life in Belgium: The Commune.

If you've just arrived, you might be wondering: "What exactly is a Commune?" 
Think of it as your local town hall, but with superpowers. It's the heart of Belgian administration.
Everything starts here. Your residence permit, your ID card, your ability to open a bank account, get health insurance, and even park your car. It all happens at the Commune.

Brussels is divided into 19 of these communes, each with its own administration.
So, your first mission is simple: You need to register where you live.
Whether you're in Ixelles, Saint-Gilles, or Brussels-City, the process is similar, but the appointment system might vary.

For EU citizens, the path is relatively straightforward. You have 3 months to register.
For non-EU citizens, you typically have just 8 days upon arrival to make yourself known to the administration.
Don't panic! It's just a formality to say "I'm here."

In this lesson, we'll walk through exactly what documents you need to gather.
Pro tip: Always bring more paper than you think you need. In Belgium, we love paper!
We'll cover the "Composition de Ménage," the police visit (yes, the police will come to check if you actually live there!), and finally, getting that golden ticket: your Belgian ID card.

It might seem bureaucratic, but think of it as your rite of passage. Once you're registered, you officially exist in the system. You're one of us!
So take a deep breath, grab your checklist below, and let's get you registered.
À tout de suite!
