## Query 1: Belgium mutuelle health insurance 2026 expats comparison

<think>
The user is asking about Belgium mutuelle health insurance for expats in 2026, with a focus on comparison. Let me analyze the search results to provide accurate, practical information for expats.

Key information from search results:
- Belgium health insurance is mandatory for all residents [1][5]
- Public system covers up to 75% of costs [1][2]
- There are five subsidized mutual funds plus public government option [1]
- Expats can choose their mutuelle [2]
- Social security contributions are mandatory [2]
- There's typically a 6-month coverage delay [3]
- EU/EFTA/UK citizens have different options than non-EU citizens [3]
- Registration is required within 3 months or face fines [5]
- Most funds offer same basic services with variations (menstrual products, physiotherapy, daycare) [2]

The search results don't provide detailed comparisons between specific mutuelles, pricing information for 2026, or which funds have better coverage levels. I should present what information is available and note what is missing.

I need to:
1. Answer directly what the search results say about mutuelle health insurance
2. Note that specific comparison details for 2026 are limited
3. Provide practical guidance on what to expect
4. Use proper citations
5. Note Belgium-specific terminology if relevant (mutuelle/ziekenfonds)
</think>

Belgium's **mandatory public health insurance** (mutuelle/ziekenfonds) for expats offers basic coverage up to 75% of medical costs, with key differences depending on your employment status and residency.[1][2]

## Registration Requirements

All residents, including expats, must register with a health insurance fund within 3 months of arrival or face fines up to €2,500.[5] To register, you'll need your employer's written confirmation of employment, valid ID (passport), residence permit, and proof of address.[4] Your employer can assist with registration, or you can visit a local social security office to apply.[4]

## Available Options

Belgium has **five subsidized mutual funds plus a public government option**.[1] All offer the same basic services, though they vary in supplementary benefits such as menstrual products, physiotherapy refunds, and daycare allowances.[2] Your employer may assign a fund, but you can choose your preferred mutuelle.[2]

## Coverage and Costs

**Mandatory contributions** are deducted automatically from your salary, with employers also contributing a percentage.[2] You'll pay upfront for medical services and then submit receipts for reimbursement through your mutuelle/ziekenfonds.[1] Public healthcare covers up to 75% of doctor appointments, prescription medications on Belgium's reimbursement list, and hospital visits, though certain treatments and private care typically require out-of-pocket payments.[1][2]

**Important limitation**: Most insurance funds delay coverage until six months after registration, meaning you're responsible for treatment costs during this period.[3] This is when supplementary private insurance becomes valuable.

## Considerations for Non-EU Expats

Non-EU/EFTA/UK citizens must prove valid health insurance coverage before entering Belgium.[3] EU/EFTA/UK citizens can initially use their EHIC (European Health Insurance Card), though this is not a substitute for mandatory Belgian registration.[2]

The search results don't provide detailed premium comparisons between specific mutuelles for 2026, so you should contact individual funds directly for current pricing based on your salary and circumstances.

## Query 2: Register mutuelle Brussels 2026 process

<think>
The user is asking about the process to register with a mutuelle (health insurance fund) in Brussels in 2026. Let me review the search results to find the relevant information.

Key information from the search results:
1. Registration process in Belgium for health insurance
2. Timeline requirements (90 days/3 months)
3. Steps needed before and after arrival
4. National Register Number requirement
5. Social security registration
6. ISI+ card
7. Fines for not registering

The search results provide detailed information about how to register for a mutuelle in Belgium. The main steps are:
1. Register address with local municipality
2. Get National Register Number (NRN/RRN)
3. Register with social security
4. Get ISI+ card
5. Register with mutuelle

I should structure this as a practical guide for someone wanting to register in Brussels specifically.

Let me organize this by:
- Direct answer about the process
- Timeline/deadline
- Steps involved
- What you need
- Optional choices (which mutuelle)
- Important notes

I need to cite appropriately from the search results.
</think>

The registration process for a **mutuelle** (health insurance fund) in Brussels involves registering with your local municipality, obtaining a National Register Number, enrolling in social security, and then selecting an insurance fund.[1][2]

## Key Timeline

You have **90 days** from arrival to register for health insurance, or you face potential fines up to €2,500.[2]

## Step-by-Step Registration Process

1. **Register your address** with your local Brussels municipality (commune). This is your first step and is required before anything else.[1]

2. **Receive your National Register Number** (Dutch: *rijksregisternummer* – RRN, French: *numéro de registre national* – NNR) from the municipality, which is essential for all subsequent registrations.[1]

3. **Register with social security** using your NRN/NRN. If you're employed, your employer typically handles this. If unemployed or self-employed, you can register yourself at the nearest social security office (Dutch: *Openbaar Centrum voor Maatschappelijk Welzijn* – OCMW, French: *Centre public d'action sociale* – CPAS).[1] Freelancers and self-employed individuals must also register with a social security fund.[2]

4. **Receive your ISI+ card** (your social security card), which contains your medical records and serves as proof of insurance status.[1]

5. **Choose and register with a mutuelle**. All mutualités offer the same basic health coverage, so your employer may enroll you automatically.[1] However, you can select your own fund if you prefer one based on religious or political affiliation, or choose a neutral option like CAAMI/HZIV.[1]

## Important Considerations

**Coverage gap**: Most insurance funds delay coverage until six months after registration, meaning you'll pay insurance fees but are responsible for treatment costs during this period.[1] Private or international health insurance can help bridge this gap.[1]

**Before arriving**: Contact your home country's public healthcare authority beforehand to understand your rights and potentially obtain an S1 form if you're transferring benefits from an EU country.[1]

**Reimbursement basis**: The Belgian healthcare system typically works on a reimbursement model—you pay upfront for medical services and claim reimbursement from your mutuelle afterward.[3]
