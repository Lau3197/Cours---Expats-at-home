Day 20. Confidence.
You know more French than you think.
The problem isn't vocabulary. It's the fear of looking stupid.
Spoiler alert: You will look stupid.
And it's fine.
I once asked a baker for a "Baiser" (kiss) instead of a "Baguette."
He laughed. I got bread. Life went on.

How to boost confidence?
1. **Talk to yourself.** Narrate your life in your apartment. "Je fais le café. Je bois le café."
2. **Shadowing.** Watch a French show (Dix Pour Cent is great). Repeat exactly what they say, immediately after they say it. Mimic the accent. Be dramatic.
3. **The 3-Second Rule.** When you want to say something, do it within 3 seconds. Any longer and your brain will stop you.

Also, **Tandems**.
Find a language partner. "I speak English, you speak French."
Meet for coffee. 30 mins English, 30 mins French.
It's free, and you make a friend.
Go make mistakes. It's the only way.
