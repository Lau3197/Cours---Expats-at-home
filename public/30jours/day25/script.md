Day 25. The Hustle.
Working in Belgium is... structured.
If you want to grow your career here, you need to understand the "Paper Ceiling."
Degrees matter. Certificates matter.
It's very old school.
"I taught myself coding" is cool in Silicon Valley.
In Belgium, they ask: "Where is your diploma?"

But! There is a hack.
**Training.**
Belgium is obsessed with training.
Companies have budgets they *have* to spend on your education.
Ask for it.
"I want to take a course in AI / Management / French."
Your boss will often say yes because it's tax-deductible.

Also: Networking.
But not the "Here is my business card" kind.
The "Let's have lunch" kind.
Belgians do business with people they trust. Trust is built over warm food, not cold emails.
Treat every lunch break as a networking opportunity.
Don't eat at your desk. It's sad, and it's bad for your career.
