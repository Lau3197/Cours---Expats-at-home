## Félicitations ! you are a Local 🎓

You have completed the 30-Day Brussels Bootcamp.
You have the tools. You have the knowledge. You have the mindset.

### The "Local" Manifesto
1.  **I will not complain about the rain.** (It's futile).
2.  **I will be patient with administration.** (It builds character).
3.  **I will say hello to my neighbors.** (It builds community).
4.  **I will explore beyond the EU Quarter.** (Real life is elsewhere).

### Staying Connected
Integration is a journey, not a destination.
*   **Keep learning French/Dutch.** Don't stop now.
*   **Stay curious.** Read *The Bulletin* or *Bruzz* to know what's happening.
*   **Be a host.** Make Brussels a welcoming place for the *next* person who arrives.

### Final Resources
