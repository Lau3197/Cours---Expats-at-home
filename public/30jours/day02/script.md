Day 2! Let's talk about money. Or rather, let's talk about where to put your money.
Welcome back. Today is all about getting your **Belgian Bank Account** set up.

You might be thinking, "Can't I just use my existing EU bank account?"
Technically, yes for some things. But practically? You really want a Belgian IBAN.
Why? Because landlords, utility companies, and internet providers often require a local IBAN for "Direct Debit" (or *domiciliation*). It makes your life infinitely easier.

In Belgium, you have two main choices:
1. The **Traditional Banks** (KBC, ING, BNP Paribas, Belfius).
2. The **Neobanks** (N26, Revolut, Bunq).

My personal recommendation? **Get both.**
Use a traditional bank (like KBC Brussels) for your "serious" life infrastructure—your salary, your rent, and especially your **Rental Guarantee**.
Then, use a neobank for your daily spending and travel.

KBC Brussels is widely considered the most expat-friendly. Their app is fantastic, and you can start the process online even before you have your final ID card.
So, grab your passport (again!), and let's get you banked. Your future landlord is waiting!
