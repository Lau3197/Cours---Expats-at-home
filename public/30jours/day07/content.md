## Week 1: The Foundation Phase Complete ✅

You have laid the groundwork for your life in Belgium. The administration here is heavy at the start, but once it's done, it's done.

### Review Checklist
Look back at your week. What is still pending?

*   **Day 1 (Commune):** Have you sent your registration email or made an appointment? If you have your "Annexe 15" or proof of application, you are safe.
*   **Day 2 (Bank):** Is your account open? Do you have an IBAN to give to your employer?
*   **Day 3 (Health):** Have you chosen a Mutuelle?
*   **Day 4 (Housing):** Are you scanning Immoweb daily? Have you set up email alerts?
*   **Day 5 (Transport):** Do you have a MOBIB card in your pocket?
*   **Day 6 (French):** Did you say "Septante" yet?

### The "Police Visit" Reminder
Remember, the police will pass by your address soon (if you registered).
**Ensure your name is on the doorbell.**
If you are staying in temporary accommodation (Airbnb / Hotel), you usually cannot register there. You need a long-term lease.

### Weekend Mission: The "Sunday Market"
To celebrate your first week, visit the **Le Marché du Midi** (Sunday morning) or **Place Flagey** (Saturday/Sunday morning).
It's the best way to feel the pulse of the city.
Eat some oysters at a standing table, buy some fresh flowers, or just hunt for bargains.
You've earned it.
