## Query 2: Entrepreneurship Belgium expats 2026

<think>
The user is asking about entrepreneurship in Belgium for expats in 2026. This is a general query about starting a business as an expat in Belgium. I should provide comprehensive but practical information based on the search results provided.

Key points to cover:
1. Whether expats can start businesses in Belgium
2. Main business structures available
3. Capital requirements
4. Specific requirements for non-EU nationals
5. Support and resources available
6. Tax considerations
7. Key sectors and opportunities

Let me structure this response starting with the core answer and then supporting details.

I need to cite appropriately from the search results and maintain the tone of being practical and actionable for expats.
</think>

Belgium is an accessible destination for expat entrepreneurs, with relatively straightforward setup processes and strong support infrastructure, though requirements differ based on your EU citizenship status.

## Who Can Start a Business

**EU/EFTA nationals** can establish a business in Belgium without restrictions or special permits[2]. **Non-EU nationals** can also start a business but typically need a Belgian residence permit and work authorization; if you're self-employed, you'll need to obtain a **Professional Card**[1][2].

Both groups must be 18 years old (16 for craftspeople) and may need to demonstrate specific qualifications depending on your industry, as some occupations in Belgium are regulated[2].

## Main Business Structures

The most common options for expat entrepreneurs are:

- **Private Limited Company (BV/SRL)**: No fixed minimum capital requirement, though a detailed financial plan is required. Offers limited liability and flexible governance[1].
- **Public Limited Company (NV/SA)**: Requires minimum capital of €61,500, more formal governance, typically for larger ventures[1].
- **Branch office**: Extends your foreign parent company to Belgium without creating a separate legal entity, but the parent remains fully liable[1].

## Financial Requirements and Support

Starting capital can be lean—the BV/SRL has no minimum capital requirement[1]. Beyond shareholder investments, you can access venture capital, regional innovation grants, R&D subsidies, and bank financing backed by regional guarantee programs[1].

## Tax and Compliance

Corporate tax is 25%, with reduced rates of 20% available for qualifying SMEs on the first €100,000 of profit[1]. VAT is applied at 21%, with reduced rates of 12% and 6% on certain goods and services[1]. You'll need to register with the Federal Public Service Finance for VAT, maintain a registered office, implement compliant bookkeeping, and obtain any sector-specific licenses[1].

## Key Sectors and Market Opportunities

Belgium's largest sector is **services**, including tourism, financial services, and IT[2]. **Manufacturing** is also significant, accounting for approximately one-sixth of GDP, with petrochemicals, food and beverages, and scientific equipment as leading areas[2]. Brussels particularly attracts entrepreneurs in tech, cleantech, and European affairs sectors[7].

## Available Support

**Regional agencies** including hub.Brussels (for Brussels-Capital Region), Flanders Investment & Trade, and AWEX (Wallonia) provide guidance and access to incentive programs[1]. **Startup accelerators** such as Start it @KBC and imec.istart offer mentoring and investor connections[1]. Professional networks like AmCham Belgium and sector-specific associations also support entrepreneurs[1].

Belgium hosts a strong entrepreneurial culture, especially in Brussels and major cities, with foreign-owned firms accounting for approximately 28% of private sector value[2].
