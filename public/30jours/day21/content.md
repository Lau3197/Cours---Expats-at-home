## Week 3 Review: The "Adulting" Badge 🎖️

You tackled the hardest part of moving: The Administration and Logistics.

### Milestone Check
*   **Recycling:** Are you separating your organic waste (orange bag) from your residual waste (white bag)?
*   **Taxes:** Do you have your "Itsme" app working? (This is your digital key to Belgium).
*   **Driving:** Have you yielded to a car coming from the right yet?
*   **Travel:** Did you visit Ghent or Antwerp?
*   **Social:** Did you try a networking event or a date?

### The "Expat Fatigue"
By Week 3, the adrenaline of moving wears off.
You might feel annoyed by small things. The rain. The closing times of shops (18:00 is early!). The bureaucracy.
**This is normal.**
It's called "Culture Shock Phase 2: Frustration."
The cure?
1.  **Acceptance:** Belgium is imperfect. That's its charm.
2.  **Comfort Food:** Go get a Waffle (Gaufre de Liège) or a hot chocolate at *Neuhaus*.
3.  **Rest:** Don't force yourself to "explore" every second. Watch Netflix. Order UberEats. It's allowed.

### Next Week: Deep Dive
We move into the soul of Belgium.
*   **Politics:** Why are there 6 governments?
*   **History:** Why is this country so weird?
*   **Future:** Planning your long-term stay.
