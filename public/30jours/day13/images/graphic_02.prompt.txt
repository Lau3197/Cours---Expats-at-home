Photo collage depicting two categories of green spaces:
1.  **Famous/Large Parks:** Show Parc du Cinquantenaire (featuring its huge arch) and Bois de la Cambre (evoking a forest-like atmosphere).
2.  **Local/Small Parks:** Show Parc Leopold (highlighting its lovely pond, located in the European Quarter) and a generic tiny green square with three benches, illustrating a spot to sit with a coffee or book for fifteen minutes.
