Day 4! The hunt for a home.
Finding a place in Brussels is competitive, but completely doable if you know the rules.
And let me tell you, the rules here are... specific.

First, forget about paying cash or handing over a check for your deposit. We discussed the "Rental Guarantee" yesterday.
Today, we're talking about the **Lease (Bail)**.
Standard leases are often 9 years. Yes, 9 years! Only in Belgium is "standard" almost a decade.
But don't panic. You can leave every 3 years without penalty, or anytime with a penalty.
There are also short-term leases (3 years or less), which are much more rigid—you basically can't break them without paying a hefty fee.

Also, have you heard of the "État des Lieux"? The Inventory of Fixtures?
This is not a quick walkthrough. It's a 30-page forensic analysis of every scratch on every tile.
Usually, you hire an expert surveyor to do this. It costs money (shared 50/50), but do NOT skip this.
If you do it yourself on a napkin, you will lose your deposit. Guarantee.

We'll also look at neighborhood vibes. Saint-Gilles for the artists, Ixelles for the socialites, Etterbeek for the EU crowd.
Brussels is a collection of villages. Choosing the right one changes your entire experience.
Let's find your dream apartment!
