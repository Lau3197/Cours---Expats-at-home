## The Brussels Hack-List 🗝️

A compilation of tips that save time, money, and sanity.

### Money Hacks
*   **Museum Pass:** Essential. €59/year. Unlimited access to almost all museums.
*   **Too Good To Go:** Brussels takes fighting food waste seriously. Use the app to get cheap sushi, bread, and groceries at closing time.
*   **Free First Sundays:** Many museums are free on the 1st Sunday of the month.

### Transport Hacks
*   **The Airport Train Surcharge (Diabolo Fee):** It costs ~€6 extra to exit at Zaventem Airport.
    *   *Hack:* Take a bus (De Lijn) to the airport if you want to avoid it (check schedules, it takes longer).
*   **STIB Monthly Pass:** If you buy the annual pass, it's cheaper than 12 monthly passes.

### Lifestyle Hacks
*   **Sunday Pharmacies (Pharmacie de Garde):**
    *   Most are closed Sundays. Google "Pharmacie de Garde [Your Commune]" to find the one open for emergencies. Warning: Surcharge applies.
*   **Copy Shops:** Need to print a return label? "Mister Copy" or "All Printing Services" are dotted around the university areas (Ixelles).
*   **Public Toilets:** A disaster zone.
    *   *Strategy:* Department stores (Galeria Inno), Fast Food chains (code on receipt), or nice Hotels (confidence required).

### Survival Phrase
*   **"Non, ça ira."** (No, that will be fine).
    *   Use when shopkeepers try to upsell you, or beggars approach. Firm but polite.
