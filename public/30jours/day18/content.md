## The Art of the Belgian Weekend 🚂

Belgium is the size of a handkerchief. Use this to your advantage.
From Friday 7 PM to Sunday night, SNCB trains offer **50% off** return tickets ("Weekend Ticket").

### The Big Three (Flanders)
1.  **Ghent (35 mins):** The local favorite.
    *   *Vibe:* Medieval meets Hipster.
    *   *Do:* Visit the Mystic Lamb (Lam Gods), eat Cuberdons (purple nose candy), drink beer at the Gruut brewery.
2.  **Bruges (60 mins):** The postcard.
    *   *Vibe:* Disney for grown-ups. Stunning but crowded.
    *   *Do:* Boat tour (cliché but worth it), Minnewater park. Avoid the restaurants on the main square (Market Place) - overpriced tourist traps.
3.  **Antwerp (40 mins):** The cool kid.
    *   *Vibe:* Fashion, Art, Diamonds.
    *   *Do:* Central Station (Cathedral of trains), MAS Museum (views), The Meir (Shopping).

### The Ardennes (Wallonia)
Need nature? Head south.
*   **Dinant:** The city with the saxophone and the citadel. Dramatic cliffs.
*   **Durbuy:** "The smallest city in the world." Stone houses, very cute, great food.
*   **Namur:** The capital of Wallonia. Hiking up to the Citadel is a workout with a view.

### The Coast (De Kust)
*   **Knokke:** Posh. Ferraris and Louis Vuitton.
*   **Ostend:** The "City at the sea." Marvin Gaye lived here. Historic and gritty.
*   **De Haan:** The prettiest one. Belle Epoque villas, no high-rises.

> **Pro Tip:** In summer, the trains to the coast are a nightmare. Go early or book a seat if possible.
