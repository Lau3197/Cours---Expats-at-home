## Dating in the Capital of Europe ❤️

The dating pool in Brussels is vast but segmented. You have the transient expat bubble and the rooted local scene.

### Cultural Differences
*   **The Belgian Way:** Slow burn. They might seem distant at first. This is respect for privacy, not disinterest. Once they crack, they are very loyal.
*   **The Expat Way:** Fast, intense, fleeting. "I'm leaving in 6 months" is a common phrase.
*   **The Date:** Usually drinks (un verre) or a casual dinner. No grand gestures. No suits (unless you work at the Commission).
*   **Paying:** "Dutch Treat" (splitting the bill) is very common and not an insult. Offer to split. If they insist on paying, accept graciously.

### Where to Meet?
*   **Apps:** Hinge (more serious), Bumble (women communicate first), Tinder (everything).
*   **Events:** "Apéros" at Place Lux (very expat/intern focused), Place Flagey (more local/hipster).
*   **Activities:** Climbing gyms. Seriously. Half of Brussels couples met while bouldering.

### The "Label"
In Anglo cultures, there is "Dating" > "Exclusive" > "Relationship."
In Belgium/France, if you have gone on 3 dates and kissed, you are basically together.
"Multi-dating" (seeing several people at once) is frowned upon and considered dishonest.

### Same-Sex Dating
Belgium was the second country in the world to legalize gay marriage (2003).
Brussels has a vibrant LGBTQ+ scene (Rue du Marché au Charbon).
Apps like Grindr, Her, and Scruff are widely used.
