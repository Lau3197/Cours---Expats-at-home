**Visual Structure:** Curated Grid/Display.
**Content:** A curated display featuring a selection of 5-7 diverse Belgian beer bottles, each precisely paired with its unique, traditional glass. Clearly highlight 2-3 specific Trappist beers (e.g., Chimay, Westmalle, Orval) within this collection, perhaps with a distinct label or subtle emphasis. Include a prominent text or icon graphic stating "UNESCO-recognized Belgian Beer Culture." A small text overlay can also emphasize "hundreds of varieties" and "many with their own special glass."
