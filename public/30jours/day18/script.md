Day 18. Escape the City.
Brussels is intense. Sometimes you need to get out.
Good news: Belgium is tiny. You can be anywhere in 2 hours.
The Holy Trinity of Belgian day trips: Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp.

**Bruges (Brugge):** It's a fairytale. But it's also a tourist trap.
Go early. Like, 8 AM early. Walk along the canals before the buses arrive.
It is stunningly beautiful.

**Ghent (Gent):** The cooler younger sister of Bruges.
It has the canals and the medieval buildings, but it also has a university and a heartbeat.
The Castle of the Counts (Gravensteen) is right in the middle of the city.
Game of Thrones vibes.

**Antwerp (Antwerpen):** Fashion. Diamonds. Influence.
The train station is one of the most beautiful in the world. (Seriously).
It feels more "big city" than Brussels in some ways.
The shopping on the Meir is intense.

And then there's the **Sea**.
The Belgian Coast. It's... unique.
It's not the Mediterranean. It's grey, windy, and lined with apartment blocks.
But there is a charm to eating shrimp croquettes while fighting the wind.
Take the "Kusttram" (Coastal Tram) - it goes along the entire coast. Longest tram line in the world!

Get a "Weekend Ticket" on the train. It's 50% off.
Go explore!
