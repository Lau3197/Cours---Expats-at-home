Discover **overlooked attractions** and charming local spots beyond the typical tourist trail:

## Street Art & Photography

The **hidden photo mosaic near Sainte-Catherine** is a powerful piece made entirely from portraits of real people holding yellow stars—when viewed from distance, they form a rainbow-colored face blending identity and diversity[1]. This captures local artistic culture without crowds.

## Parks & Gardens

**Mont des Arts** offers both the carillon clock tower (built in 1964 on the Palace of the Dynasty) and peaceful gardens with symmetrical hedges and city views, frequented by photographers and locals seeking quiet breaks between museum visits[1]. For local people-watching, **Brussels Park (Parc de Bruxelles)** near Place Royale provides shaded benches, fountains, and authentic neighborhood atmosphere[1].
